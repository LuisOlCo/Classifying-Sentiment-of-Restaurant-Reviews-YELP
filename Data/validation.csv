0,"really solid lunch deals and pretty close to tex mex which i still get cravings for from time to time . i had the spinach chicken enchiladas and they were nice . it was a ton of food of course so we definitely needed boxes for leftovers . if you re in the neighborhood , it s a solid deal and i d stop in again . my only wish is that they did a green sauce with the spinach chicken enchiladas . that would be heaven .

0,"this place was kinda cool . we first got there around on a saturday night . the place was dead . . . but that is to be expected for a night club . the drinks are expensive , but tasty . the decor is amazing . the couches are comfy and there is just enough seating space without it overtaking the joint . we ended up leaving after drink and went back a few hours later and the place was busy busy busy . they had great music playing and the dance floor was full . one downfall was , i hate when you go to a bar and the bathroom has an attendant that you need to tip . they are holding everything that you need . . . soap and paper towels . i feel that i shouldnt feel forced to tip someone because i wanted to wash my hands after i used the bathroom . overall the place was decent . i am new in town and i am sure that there are better places to have a drink . i will most likely go back in the future , just not in a rush to .

1,"ok ok . . . as a proud italian i hope my momma don t see this ! i m actually going to give d moes a star rating for a few reasons . last friday , me and my brothers left the suns game , and proceed to put a few adult beverages back . at around am , when haney s shut down , we had an overwhelming craving for crap pizza its better than our normal jack in box at am run that usually ends up with someone puking in the drive thru line because the smell of the taco sauce is so amazing . low and behold , the only spot that was still taking orders up to am ! was d moes . now , st off i live at summitt by bob . these guys gladly delivered to me , all the way down there ! major props for that . they understood me . . . considering i don t remember ordering the pizza i woke up to pizza and wings boxes all over my pad , and me saying who ordered pizza then i burped . . . wing sauce and vodka is a healthy combo . apparently , after checking my voice mail , the driver was pounding on our door for about minutes we were really jamming out to rock band , in case you don t know , were pretty awesome . wikipedia that ish ladies and gent s kansas city bullriders . well , the driver and my door man both called times . i m assuming the driver eventually came in and grabbed the bass guitar and strummed it out . maybe he had a slice with us ? who really knows these things . however , i do know that i was insanely impressed with d moes . . . from the left overs i ate the next when i could remember . it was pretty darn good . between the awesome ness that is called their customer service and the legit taste it left in my mouth , i m a believer , unless , if i say i m not , will i get a commercial ? . . . hmmmm . . . . potential there . . . .

1,"i would never have stopped at the wy knot cafe if it had not been for a friend mentioning it in a post on facebook . i am glad i saw that post . there have been a number of restaurants in that location that have failed . wy knot has opened the space up , made it dog friendly it is named for their dog and has a great menu . you order at the counter and then they bring the food out to you . the employees were all very friendly . the only down side was the lack of parking due to the other businesses sharing a lot . also there were hardly any customers . hopefully they will deliver menus to the houses in the neighborhood and maybe do some promotions on the neighborhood e mail service so people will know what they have to offer . i would like to see them make it . they serve breakfast and lunch all day . they had a variety of choices and it was hard to decide on one . we split a blt and a chicken salad sandwich so we could try both . they come with a side of beet salad or salad of the day . the beet salad was very good . we both preferred the blt but i am sure the chicken salad was more healthy and it was tasty as well . give them a try , i think you will enjoy the wy knot cafe . i will be back .

1,"excellent trip to the spa ! ! ! ! ! a trip to the aji spa located at the sheraton wildhorse pass resort and spa was at the top of my list during my recent trip to arizona on memorial day weekend . we made our reservations well in advance . having gone to a few spa resorts , i couldn t wait to pay this one a visit . my cousin and i were each booked for the little yellow bird spa package , which was comprised of services each . we arrived about minutes prior to our appointment time and was given a tour of the spa . after changing in the women s locker room , and relaxing in the private women s lounge area there s a large lounge area , but it s co ed , our masseuses met us and brought us into our room . my cousin and i decided for our first service to be the companion massage . after only having solo massages , i was interested how a companion massage differed . the minute aji massage flew by . my masseuse was professional and the massage given was very comfortable , relaxing and beneficial . after our massages were completed , we had some time in between our next service , feeling a little hungry , we decided to grab some lunch from the spa s cafe . i ordered the flatbread pizza and it was to die for ! seeded flatbread topped off with a garlic peppery aioli , grilled chicken pieces , pesto sauce , marinated bell peppers , melted cheese and avocado . my visit was a month and a half ago and my memory , a little fuzzy , but that was one of the best lunches i ve had in a long time ! ! after lunch sometime , we each were up for our second service , our facials ! ! ! due to my skin type , i received the aji rain facial . my esthetician was wonderful ! her hands were soft and gentle while working on my face and we had some lovely conversation during the minute procedure . i left that room with my face feeling renewed , clean and fresh ! all spa treatments include full use of the spa s facilities so we definitely made well use of that ! after our facials , we used the sauna the steam room was out of service during our visit and whirlpools located on the women s locker side . we then relaxed and lounged by the outside pool . the aji spa is such a calm , warm and relaxing environment that i ended up taking a nap ! outside ! in desert heat ! thank goodness for the wooden awning with misters attached and the huge patio umbrellas providing shade ! the staff at the spa provided excellent service ! from the front desk , to our masseuse , the esthetician , the cafe staff and the locker room attendant ! while napping , one of the staff from the cafe even brought us iced water with lemon and cucumber slices in it ! our appointment started at pm and with our procedures , and lunch , we should have been done and out of there within a few hours . but the point of visiting the spa was to relax , and with aji spa being such a lovely place , we just didn t want to leave ! we finally left nearly hours after our arrival , and we would have stayed longer if we could ! i highly recommend aji spa to anyone visiting the phoenix area , or if you re looking for a new spa to travel to ! aji spa is a beautiful spa with excellent staff and service . they even emailed me the same day of my service as a thank you for visiting and included a discount coupon on my next visit ! a star spa , indeed !

1,"a roadtrip would not be complete without local bbq and bobby s does not disappoint ! fancy smancy table service dark and cool with bar seating rotisserie chick and bragging about the ribs . alex was friendly and rattled off drink specials . other servers were chatting with friends at the bar and one , blond one dipped into her cleavage for something . i hope she washes her hands before serving up a meal . now i look around , this is a breaking ground for hooters . low cut and falling out . not a fan of that . bobby q amber ale sonoran brewing is too light with a bitter bite . not my type of amber but they tried . meats , brisket sausage w mac cheese and . . . the pecan coleslaw ? what the heck for . pulled pork sandwich meat with pork and brisket ranch house salad corn bread pucks of sweet , warm goodness . sides were great ! the beans with zest , the m c takes me back to old school cafeteria , the potato salad was fantastic and the slaw was great with the pecan . brisket was the clear winner from the table and we all loved the smoky sausage . the pulled pork was a disappointing third as it was dry . good thing i went with brisket . two thumbs up here kids . well worth your time and money . yelp check in brought a off the total tab too .

1,"very nice . the owner supports soldiers we used a uso voucher here for a quick last minute getaway before my husband deployed . the rooms are very clean and seem really updated . the staff is extremely nice and helpful , and the breakfast is pretty good . it s also right next to ikea , can t go wrong there !

1,"had the pleasure of enjoying house of tricks last night , for the second time in the past twelve months . with a party of six , i was excited to get to see a range of dishes and try out most of the menu via my dining companions choices . the restaurant , found in tempe near asu , is not hard to find and houses both indoor and outdoor seating . the outdoor seating is where we ended up last night and between the fire pit in the middle of the grounds and the abundance of trees greenery , the setting works quite well . our party was seated immediately and without problem , the night was off to a solid start . our waitress , jamie , was both friendly and courteous . jamie had a great understanding of the menu , the specials and especially the wine . her recommendations for multiple members of the party worked out perfectly . each person in our party ordered an appetizer and off we went . i had the pork belly , on jamie s suggestion . other choices within our party included the salmon cake , sweetbreads two ways , and the scallops . i thought the pork belly was great . it had a pea puree as a base sauce and some baby carrots that just killed . the scallops were tasty and cooked perfectly . the sweetbreads two ways were a bit of a letdown . as a lover of sweetbreads , i have had the pleasure of tasting some of the best variations of there preparation . these were just not that great . they weren t cooked properly and the seasoning was lacking . this would be the only lacking dish of the evening . for the entree , i had the pork osso bucco . this was a real treat , cooked evenly , tender and tasty . other entree selections around the table included the ahi tuna , the salmon , and the duck . the tuna was the standard seared variety on a bed of mashed potatoes . both diners who chose this selection were quite satisfied . my companion had the duck and while she certainly enjoyed the dish , she found the duck slightly fatty . all around , the entrees were solid and plates were cleaned . with little room left for dessert , we ordered three selections for the table to share . all were good and once again our plates were cleaned off . the dessert best was agreed upon to be the homemade smore the restaurant produces . all in all , this is a solid restaurant with a good atmosphere and good service . i would eat here again and recommend you to do the same .

1,we ordered seabass and ribs . both excellent choices . service very good . ambiance was unexpected . felt like we were in hawaii with an open feel with palm trees . used restaurant . com coupon . great deal . 
0,"i feel like top s has been getting angrier and more bitter over time . i called on fourth of july just to see if they were open and they guy on the other line told me , yeah and we re a madhouse . each minute i spend on the phone with you is another body out the door , and hung up on me . i wanted to call back and tell him , you know , the amount of time that it took you to say that , you probably lost two bodies out there door . you could have just said , yes we are ! and that would have sufficed . instead , you had to be snarky so i m calling you back specifically to waste your time . instead , i m just going to yelp about it . on multiple occasions coming back over the past few months , i feel like i m tip toeing through the house when someone s mad at me . i don t get it . there s a serious vibe of negativity going on . specifically , the guy who acted like a fuckface over the phone has been snarky and bitchy a few times to me . oh , and refrigerate your fucking beer . i m tired of having to pop my shit in the freezer for minutes cause the beer or champagne i buy is piss warm .

1,"i was a lucky girl the other night . rico , b s husband has moved from z tejas to the herb box so i got to tag along to the practice night , i m sure there s technical term for if for those in the business but for me it meant free dinner at one of my favorite places . first , the decor . you can t work in interior design for six years and not notice design . they ve done it up in a cozy cape cod feel with exposed beams , wide plank floors , lots of blue and sea colors . not so much you feel like you re in a sea food restaurant , but in a chic way . it has a little bit of a contemporary feel and the bathrooms are very cool . check out the sinks . go on . you need to go just for that . b and i got there first , another friend was meeting us but was running a little late so we started with the cilantro crab dip , one of my favorites . there are nice , big chunks of crab in it and the plantain chips it comes with are thin , crisp and salty . for the main course b decided on the goat cheese chicken and enjoyed it . our other friend got her old standby the market sunflower salad and added salmon . i debated between the trout and the short ribs and ultimately decided on the short ribs but think next time i ll go with the trout . i have to say the short ribs were the second best i ve had , in line right behind chelsea s kitchens . for dessert our waiter brought us a slice of the stout cake with espresso frosting , pure heaven , and a piece of the blackberry bread pudding . the bread pudding was more like a steamed dumpling and was lacking in flavor though the creme anglais it came with was creamy and unctuous . the espresso frosting on the cake reminded me of penuche candy . i wasn t too excited to get a piece of cake but it really was a nice treat . i just ate the frosting off the back i was so full by this time . the herb box also has a beautiful patio with big windows opening to the bar and comfortable , intimate fireplaces . this is such a convenient location right in old town and steps away from the mall , i know it will become a regular place for me .

1,"went here for the first time last week and had a great experience . the restaurant was very clean , the service was great . the best part ? the food . i ve been in az for years now and i can say without a doubt that its some of the best food i ve had in a restaurant and this from a pregnant woman no less i had the fried chicken tenders , cheesy grits and fried okra . first , the food came out piping hot , i mean steaming and hot to the touch . the batter on the chicken was thick and crispy . the grits were cooked to perfection dry enough to hold together a bit but still moist . and the okra was fantastic , too . it didn t hurt that my fresh lemonade came in a mason jar , either . i will be back . a lot "
1,"i really like maizie s , but unfortunately will not get to go as often anymore . i hate to report that after our last visit , my husband received a bad bout of food poisoning . it was , in fact , his first time puking in approximately years . it was not pleasant for him and it was not pleasant for me . for that reason , i guess i m going to have to drop one star from my previous review . the thing is , i really love maizie s . i love their menu and i love their atmosphere . unfortunately , the portobello sandwich . . . or maybe it was the cottage cheese . . . just doesn t love my husband and that means i don t get to visit quite as often .

0,i was looking for chile rellenos and this place does a great job of making them just the way i like it . flavorful and not dry . also had the chips and salsa which i did not think were anything special and you have to order them unlike most mexican places where it is expected at the time they serve the drinks . flan was unimpressive . i think i will go back for the chile rellenos and head down the street to carlsbad tavern for the flan theirs is my favorite . 
0,"i know i might some flack for only giving this place stars , but really . . . . it s no different than chang s . if i could give half stars , i would give it a . . why ? because i think it s better than chang s . it s exactly the same menu just not as diverse , but cheaper . if you are at this location , try tott s instead . i bet you ll start going there more often than here .

1,"i first joined hr fitness about a year ago , and i have had nothing but good experiences with the staff since the first day that i came in . the people behind the front desk have always been very kind and attentive to my needs . if i ever have a question or concern , it is always promptly answered or dealt with . some of them have even taken the time to learn my name and greet me as soon as i walk in the door ! it is very impressive and makes for a very pleasant experience . on another note , i have been training with trace for about months now . my goal was to lose a little bit of weight and tone up my body , and i could not be happier with the results ! in months i have lost lbs . and i look and feel amazing ! he is incredibly knowledgeable about training and nutrition , giving his clients hard workouts as well as meal plans . trace is the total package ! tip try trace s boot camp on wednesday evenings at . they will kick your butt ! !

0,i went there on march th in the late afternoon . my friend ordered before me and got a burger meal . and the power went out right as i was ordering ! ! my friend ordered about minutes before me so i got to eat some of her steak fries . . . . the were awesome ! ! other than that not much else to say . gotta try them again some time . the nutter butter shake looked full of calories but delicious . better luck next time ! 
1,"i loved the crispy crust of the pizza thought it was super good . i think if you haven t been there and are at the san tan mall shopping that its worth a visit . we went on a double date and it was a pretty good experience . the only issue i had was that i thought they had a very small dining area , which was probably the reason for the min wait . also we went on a friday night and probably because of the small area it got very loud , which i know the management has no control over , but just an fyi of my experience . i d say if you haven t been and you love pizza its worth the visit . i may try and stop in for lunch sometime but definitely not on a friday night , it was just too busy .

1,"i am impressed ! i finally got a chance to check out the mim yesterday and i was really wowed by the extensive collection . i knew going in to expect items from all over the world , but there are literally instruments and related objects from every country . we spent between two and two and a half hours but it still wasn t enough time to really take in everything . i loved that the audio video guide was included in the admission price . most museums i have been to charge an additional fee . this was unlike any guide i have experienced before . no numbers to punch in , just walk by any of the exhibits with your headset on and when you stop at each video screen , the audio automatically starts up ! very cool , and i loved watching all the videos to learn more about all the instruments . when i walked up to the flamenco part of the spain exhibit i instantly recognized the video playing as i have actually been in the flamenco club in madrid where it was filmed so i thought that was neat . i really enjoyed all of the exhibits especially seeing the guts of the steinway piano and how martin guitars are made . it s not something i had thought about much before but now i know so much ! i think the mim is a fab place to take kids and adults ! to learn and to get them excited about music . definitely check it out it you haven t yet . edited to add if you are a bank of america card holder , you can get into the mim for free the first full weekend of each month in .

1,"brackin s is my new favorite day drinking spot . the bar itself is located perfectly within a tucked away area in the old town scottsdale mall area . the atmosphere is very relaxed , and when the owners swing by , they really make an effort to get to know you . prices are also very relaxed , with bottled beer landing right around for domestics . all in all , if you are looking for a spot to hang out with a couple drinks , maybe enjoy some live music , and do some people watching i would definitely recommend brackin s .

1,"stumbled into this place while vacationing in scottsdale for spring training . i was suffering from one of those hangovers that makes you feel your pulse in your dome . my buddy who was campaigning for breakfast at taco bell . . who does that ? was driving like a kamikaze pilot and responded to the vehicle full of people pointing towards paradise and grunting uggghhh . while walking up to the door an odd brown dribble stain was pointing us towards the entrance . didn t know what to make of this . also wasn t sure if it was from my friends who had plodded in ahead of me . once entering this fine establishment my not so working correct brain couldn t comprehend the two different counters . also confusing was the two menus . being told what was going on by a nice gal behind the counter didn t help much since english was definitely my second language at this point in time . after just pointing at what i needed i was ushered along to the cash register . i got my number sat with my group and waited . . . . . and waited . . . . . . and waited . as more time passed i began to ponder what the actual construction and building time for a croissant sandwich was . also helping was my wife reminding me of every person that got there food ahead of me . we were asked how are food was a couple of times so i figure they could sense my frustration as to not having it . then my glorious croissant sandwich was brought to me . it tasted absolutely magnificent . i could have died right then and been happy . to make up for this delay the manager brought us three boxes of cookies . i didn t catch her name , but damn if she didn t pass customer relations . tossing me a free oj would ve been sufficient , but to give this wild pack of drunken animals munchies for the weekend went above and beyond . i will definitely crawl back in the next time i visit scottsdale .

1,i eat there about times a week ! ! the antipasto salad and bread are addicting and can t be beat ! 
1,"hipster hangout you can drag the kids along and not feel bad about it . the place is setup like a house and the first time you go it is for sure confusing . do i sit down or go to the counter or bar or what . . its kind of a free for all . i have been a few times and still feel a little awkward when i walk in . the hot chocolate is great and the egg sandwich tasty . the mac and cheese for evening is also really good . the service is ok , but not overly helpful or friendly . the place is dripping with kids too cool for school , businessmen , and families . . . so a great spot to hit up if you are in downtown phx"
0,"my wife and i stopped by last weekend to watch football and sample a couple of their brews . the food was great could be some of the best french fries i ve ever had . the beer was good . noticed almost everyone drinking the house beers so it was nice to see that kind of support for an established micro brew . there was a large crowd for football many folks wearing jerseys and everyone really getting into their game . if your looking for an energetic place to watch football and grab a good bite this would be a place to consider . updated lowered to stars . i have been here a couple times since my first review and it really is just an average place . the fries are the highlight . the place is small , loud and well your average pub or brewery .

1,"spotted donkey cantina is amazing ! they have delicious mexican food , and fantastic margaritas to wash everything down with . you do have to pay for chips and salsa here , so there probably won t be any of that four bowl snacking before your main entree s come , but the medley of salsa s it comes with make it all worth it . i ve tried quite a few of the dishes here , and they ve all been excellent . in no particular order are my favorites cheddar enchilada s with hatch chiles and rice . . . spicy ! santa fe macaroni and cheese . . . again spicy ! cod and shrimp tostada s delicious ! shrimp fajitas shrimp tacos and for dessert fried banana wraps or the mango margarita sundae !

1,"treats we tried the cookies chocolate chip and chocolate truffle and would have to give them stars . delicious ! breakfast seems like they changed the recipe for the turkey maple sausage so it now has an odd herb flavor and less maple flavor , but tried the flattened meatball and liked it so might switch to that option . if you go , be sure to check out the bathrooms . each one was decorated uniquely by a staff member , and the sinks are shared by both genders . you also get to see how very clean kitchen the kitchen is as you walk to the bathrooms , so that is a great bonus . overall , a great non chain place for unique and delicious food .

1,don t know why it took me this long to check out joe s farm grill but my out of towners got a kick of this place . we ordered fontina burger bbq chicken pizza grilled veggie pizza sweet potato fries garlic fries onion rings chocolate milk shake the good great selection of american food good portion sizes allow upgrades to different kinds of fries to your meal the decor cute history behind the farm open kitchen sauce bar friendly staff outdoor picnic benches under a huge tree where the kiddies can enjoy themselves hand washing fountain conveniently located by the soda fountain kiddies love the cool restrooms the bad lots of flies outside that s summer in a farm for you limited seating inside real vanilla milkshake tasted weird too much lemon juice ? 
1,nicely edited selection of mid to high end electronics . knowledgeable and professional staff . these guys and gals know what they are talking about and will go the extra mile in terms of customer service . thinking about splurging on a home theater ? ask for scott . he will listen to you and help you build your dream system within your budget . he will even respond to your hi fi emergencies eg . the guests are arriving for your super bowl party and you don t remember how to work the mission control style remote .

1,i like over easy . the former location had more charm but this one is bigger and you don t have to wait as much the food is great and the owners are wonderful and friendly . we just ate breakfast there . i got the eggs over easy with mushrooms . the eggs were way too raw . i told the server about it and i asked to just get eggs over easy instead of remaking the dish as the kid in the table was getting grumpy . that s what i ate for breakfast . the server didn t take it off the bill . i wouldn t say anything about it but i didn t get to eat the dish i wanted but still got to pay for it . not cool . the ppllo loco is great ! hopefully this is a one time issue and the owners are still on top of everything like they used to be . 
1,"after reading the other reviews , i thought perhaps i would weigh in they seem to be all over the place . the critics are correct that the decor seems dated . to me , having grown up back east with this very sort of restaurant , it was charming . the restaurant is particularly enjoyable to visit at night , when they turn on the lights in the garden . i enjoy the layout of the dining room , although i agree it is a cooler experience to eat in the bar . i guess some people could be offended that the staff sit down and eat in the bar when it is slow , but i m not one of those people i think it adds to the charm . i had a very late lunch yesterday around thanks to an appointment that went on forever . so we ended up heading to riazzi s for a late dinner , around . at that time of the evening , the dining room was closed . , so we sat in the bar . their service is truly one of the strengths of this restaurant . on this night , they were unusually attentive even for them . the waters came out immediately upon sitting down , then they took your drink order as it should be . neither my iced tea or water ever got below half a glass . this is something i occasionally find annoying at places where the staff draws a lot of attention to itself when they refill drinks particularly when it interrupts the flow of conversation . not at riazzi s they are attentive but unobstrusive . their bread is my favorite restaurant bread in the valley hands down . it is actually better than the italian bread i grew up eating back east in hartford , new york , boston and providence . it s so good that i wish they had loaves available . you have to possess a lot of discipline not to fill up on the bread . the salad is as others have described it traditional , but fresh . my favorite item on the menu is now listed under pizzas and described as a spinach pie . this used to be listed under appetizers as the grass pie , but if you order a grass pie , they ll still know what you mean . it is a cheeseless pizza with spinach and arrabiata sauce . confession i love all things arrabiata . but this combination here is perfect . for about . i can t recall the exact figure , they ll add mozzarella to it , but i ve never done that because it is perfect as it . they bring you a healthy amount of tasty parmesan cheese , so you can always throw that on the spinach pie . so , i had that . outstanding as usual . my wife ordered the penne primavera , which was very good . last time i was there with my daughter , she had the penne with garlic and oil , which i thought was just superb . simple , but perfect for a garlic fan like me . i have a feeling most folks skip over such an entree in favor of something more elaborate , but i recommend it . we didn t have an appetizer , and even though i wouldn t describe the portions as enormous , they were generous and neither of us could finish our entrees . is riazzi s going to be sexy for the young , hip crowd ? probably not , although it is romantic at night with their lights and sunken elevated dining room , and has the cool factor of the bar . it totally hit my nostalgic for the east coast italian restaurant needs . i just wish the service at most modestly priced valley eateries approached riazzi s . you can get spoiled with the bread and service over here .

1,"i ve been to this location a few times , but this was by far the best experience i ve had . it was two sundays ago , myself and seven friends wanted to watch the early games and get some food and drinks . my friend called ahead and made a reservation . when we got there , we had a big table reserved right in front of all the tvs . our waitress was very attentive , friendly and quick . they had a bunch of beer bucket deals that we all took advantage of and had a great time watching all the games , enjoying some beverages and eating some food . their breakfast burrito with chorizo was fantastic and it ll keep me coming back . see ya next sunday , majerle s !

1,"i now have a sixth sens for delicious asian tapas a genre i never knew existed . i always assumed the best tapas disappeared when aaron may sauteed sol y sombra s last batch of butter marinated brussels sprouts ! well , i was proven wrong when i hit up the ultra cool sens asian tapas sake on a thursday night . guests are greeted by electric blue lights , neon pink lotus blossom light fixtures and fresh beats courtesy of a hipster dj , which transport the hungry to an intoxicating , fluorescent experiens filled with sauces , sakes , and spicy flavors they probably don t even know about yet . i tried three top notch items wasabi tofu hot , in every sens of the word . wasabi and degree tempura crusties have the ability to burn you to your soul if you aren t careful . don t skip it , just poke it with a chopstick or blow on it first . white peach juice and vodka just like japanese candy exchange students brought home in high school , it s one of those miraculous flavors most americans will never have the opportunity to try . light and sweet , but not overly so , it s a perfect blend you can sip all . night . long . i did ! the best , by far , is the hot sour soup . it s nothing like the kind you get for . at chinese restaurants as an appetizer . a bilbo baggins ey cauldron arrives with a wooden ladle among the various veggies and disc shaped noodles is your choice of meat i chose clams . i ve always heard you can truly tell how talented a chef is by how tasty his soup is , and would have to agree . there s nothing to hide behind , and you re confronted by pure flavor . it was complex , different and mouthwatering . the whole sens ation was so genius , i even got past the embarrassment of chef johnny chu snorting in my face for taking pics of my meal on my iphone .

0,"i wanted to add a review to the actual company s website , but i could not figure it out . i m curious where all the testimonials came from . i have mixed feelings on my experience . in the end , i think i ended up with some beautiful windows , though . my salesperson was very engaging . i felt pretty confident in my decision to go with american vision windows after that first experience . there was some miscommunication on scheduling the measurement , but it worked itself out fairly quickly . i started to lose confidence when i was told a specific date that my windows would be in , but never heard anything from the company four days after that date . when i called them to find out where my windows were , i was told they had just received them and they could schedule my install in weeks . since i only had saturday install available , that was understandable . the friday before my install , they called to reschedule to the following weekend because the rainstorm that just occurred that day had put them behind two days . again , i guess that was fairly understandable , but i felt like the peon that was the easiest to push off . luckily the installers did show up the following saturday on the earlier side of the provided time frame . i kind of don t know what to say about the install . there were two guys , one seemed to know what he was doing , the other i had less confidence in . the job took hours to install windows . during the entire transaction i was never told how long the install would take , so i m not sure if that was normal or not . the two guys actually seemed to be fighting during the entire install . i believe the head guy was joking around with the other by basically telling him he sucked . i think the other guy was genuinely getting angrier and angrier . in all honesty , i was very uncomfortable being in my own house while the install was going on . i was a bit disappointed in the cleanup of the job . i ended up having to cleanup inside the window tracks and windowsills on the inside and brush off the sills on the outside . i don t feel i should have had to do that . before they left , i was handed a survey to review the entire process salesperson , overall experience , install . i think that is a horrible practice that needs to be changed . i didn t want to sit there writing out a review on all of the above while the installer is waiting for me , and then hand it right back to him . what it did cause me to do is overstate my review because i m not going to give the installers stars and hand the paper back to the person i just reviewed . i can t say i would recommend this company , but i feel the way customer service has been going , it s really a tossup on what you will get from any company . p . s . i forgot to mention my plants . i have recently spent a lot of my own time and money on landscaping my backyard so this stuck out to me big time . i understand when installing windows it s difficult to pay attention to the foliage below your feet , but i think some attempt to not trample all over the plants would be very much appreciated . for example , when washing the windows , i think an effort can be made not to stand directly on top of a plant and twist your foot back and forth . i m still hoping i do not loose a couple of plants due to the trauma they endured .

0,"for such a small space , stinkweeds definitely does a good job of packing as much variety as they can in their store . as far as record stores go , they ve got a pretty decent collection in both cd s and vinyl . my only qualm with this place is that they tend to only carry newer stuff or the more popular titles of indie genres . if you re like me and like to peruse through older and hard to find collections , be sure to check out tracks in wax a few blocks down the street on central . that being said , this is definitely a place you ll want to drop into . their selection of concert music video dvd s is pretty solid as is what their magazine stand has to offer . sure , it s no amoeba but it s the next best thing .

1,"i was given a gift card to use at willow stream spa last december . . . i ve been waiting for the perfect day to use it since then . well , guess what ? today was that day ! with my fiance out of town for the weekend , i took advantage of some much deserved gabi time as i like to call my downtime . i called a few days ago to make an appointment and i asked if there were any specials going on . lucky for me , there were several ! the one that was most appealing to me was the book any or minute treatment and get a complimentary minute treatment to go with it . i chose to book a minute aromatherapy facial and a minute complimentary massage to go with it . . . i was in heaven ! i ll back up a moment and just say that i ve been to the willow stream spa before . . . years ago . today was even more heavenly than i remembered . i checked in around noon and didn t leave until after pm . i could ve stayed longer , but i had to come home to take minnie out ! the willow stream facility is gorgeous and includes every amenity you can imagine . . . i started out in the fitness room for a quick workout and then took a glorious shower before my massage and facial . i had tomi for my massage and she focused on my neck , back , and shoulders . . . i ve been having shoulder pain so i think she customized this based on my situation . she was fantastic but with just minutes , it felt like a tease . . . my facial made it all worthwhile though it was pure bliss ! heather was my esthetician and did a fabulous job . i highly recommend her she explained every product she was using as i fell in and out of a relaxing sleep while she not only worked on my face but my shoulders , chest , neck , scalp , hands and feet . . . the products felt amazing and smelled good too . so much so that i bought a couple on my way out . after my services , i had lunch a delicious salad with veggies and chicken while i wrote some thank you notes and read my book . . . it was so peaceful . it was like an escape from the world and i enjoyed every second of it ! so , bottom line if you are thinking about getting a spa lover like me a gift anytime soon , willow stream spa giftcards are always welcome . . . what an experience ! i m feeling energized , relaxed , and peaceful .

0,"despite being a red blooded american male , i find this place a bit below average . yes , the waitress wander around in shorts that would make a cheerleader blush but rail thin bottle blondes don t do anything for me or the food itself . i ve eaten here twice the first time , i ordered huevos rancheros and coffee today , i had the protein pancakes . in both cases , the service was mixed and the food was bland . my food came out quickly both times , but my server disappeared each time as well . today , i sat for minutes until i was able to get the attention of a manger who located my server for me . the food itself is not bad , but nothing to cheer about . the protein pancakes were enormous and dense , but not nearly as flavorful as one expects from an item filled with almonds , blueberries , and cinnamon . as others have noted , they ll ding you on side orders sour cream , tomatoes , guacamole , and the like will all cost you a pretty penny for diner quality stuff . finally , it doesn t affect the food , but the decor is garish and plain . remember that first apartment you got after college with the white walls and tan carpet ? this is basically the us egg aesthetic .

1,"very good , cheap chinese food . lots of specials including beer . the only problem was that one of the servers had her two kids there who were making noise and literally crawling on the patrons tables . if this is a regular occurrence , get the food to go . "
1,"good food for a good price . first time i ve eaten at this location but it was as good as i hoped . i got a half size crunch roll for an appetizer , and an order of chicken yakisoba . both were very good . the crunch roll was very fresh with good quality ingredients , crunchy shrimp tempura , crab , avocado , etc . the yakisoba wasn t quite what i thought it would be in that the noodles and meat were separate , not mixed , but that didn t affect the quality or flavor . it was closing time and i d only eaten half , but i packed up the rest and brought it back to my motel so the workers could finish up and go home . this was the fourth place i d attempted to go to for dinner so i was especially happy to find them open . the first place , azucar peruvian , was right across the street from the motel i always stay at and i d been meaning to try them since last summer . i drove over there to find they were now out of business with a sign up advertising the place going in next . i snoozed , i loozed . the second place was supposed to be open till pm according to their yelp listing , but was closed when i got there a few minutes after . the third place , omega gyros , highly recommended on yelp , was also out of business . fml . so when i got to yogi s i was holding my breath till i saw they were open till nine . thank you yogi s !

1,"seriously , better than any other gyro place i have ever been . the meat is the real stuff , not frozen strips heated up . pitas are hot and slightly toasted . here s the unusual part absolutely spectacular fries ! if you are like me and hate soggy limp fries , you don t have to worry at jt s . perfectly crispy on the outside , soft on the inside the way fries are supposed to be . i usually have to order my fries well done and at other places they are still soggy . not here . i have taken two fry snobs here to see what they thought and they both gave them rave reviews !

1,"the staff is really helpful . i arrived without credit card due to a travel mishap and they were great about providing assistance to get me to a bank to help clear things up . their bell staff is friendly and knowledgable . they can and will get you anywhere in town . room was okay . clean , well furnished and updated . i had a window overlooking the courtyard and i would recommend avoiding that . it can get a little loud at night . banquet food was good . not great , but good and plentiful . good variety of dishes for everyone from salads and sandwiches to hot dishes . a few of the items were a little salty for my taste but with a buffet style service , if something didn t suit , you could replace it with something else . the break service was astonishing they really go all out ! if you are visiting during the right weather , do not miss the pool area . it s fantastic !

1,"we stumbled upon this little place in a worn strip mall by accident , but it ended up being a very happy accident . yes , it is true that the decor will not be gracing the pages of fashion magazines anytime soon , but this is a clean , no frills kind of place . there is also no point in coming here if you are pressed for time , because it is not fast food by any stretch of the imagination . most importantly , the food is good . really good . the menus must have changed since other reviewers visited , because there was no arabic on the menu . everything is in english . i had the falafel plate and my companion had the lamb shank and rice . both meals came with a wonderful lentil soup that i have had at fattoush many times but this one was so much better . the falafel plate came with falafel of course , a questionable salad , pita that looked homemade , and some of the tastiest hummus i ve ever had . it was a huge amount of food , but it was so good that i was compelled to order an extra side of hummus to go with the leftovers . the lamb was apparently very tasty also i m not much of a lamb fan , so i didn t try it . the accompanying rice was very tasty though very complex with many different flavors , but none of them were overwhelming . at . for the falafel and . for the lamb plate , the prices are more than reasonable , especially when you consider that each entree can easily end up being two meals . i admit that i am partial to middle eastern food and rarely meet a falafel that i dislike , but this was definitely one of the better examples of the cuisine in the metro phoenix area . i will definitely be back , and maybe next time i ll try the chicken .

1,"i came here in december and look forward to my next trip so i can get some more of the tuna noodle casserole ! it was so basic sounding on the menu , but when away from home its comfort food . so i got it and it was way better than what i make . now i need to have it again so i can figure out how it was done ! i can t describe it , but man it was ridiculous ! my husband had the big unit . he shared it with others , but he could ve easily eaten the entire dog . it was long and skinny . the toppings aren t heavy either . the catcher mitt dessert wasn t to die for . parking is a pain in that area , especially since the meters only took coins .

1,"i really love it here . there is a big window that looks into the kitchen where you can watch the noodle chef hand make the noodles for your dish . my favorite is , beef with lemon garlic noodles . the beef is sliced thin and served cold . the sauce is a fish sauce , the fish smell is pretty strong , but it doesn t taste strong , the citrus and garlic are more evident . the only reason i m not giving stars is because the water taste really funny here . opt for a soda .

0,"i have to say i avoid this store as much as i can . i have lived in this same neighborhood for years , so i have had to go to this store many times over the years . they just never understand customer service at this location . it is very close to where i live but , i would rather drive a little further for fresh and easy . however , i this night i thought i would just stop here for a quick shopping experience . my boyfriend was really sick and i wanted to take him some fresh chicken soup that they make and sell here . so here i am at at night on a weekday . one cashier is open , yes only one in a store that size ! ! ! mind you the store is packed . the line is all the way down the frozen food isle . there are registers where you can check your self out but , no one is there to help them all busy . . and it is winter in molasasville . so slow . i am sorry and don t want to sound like i am above it all , but i do not have time to waste like this . this is not a one time experience either . this is one of the biggest reasons i hate going to this store . i have been to other safeways around the valley that are not like this . the one on th street for instance . they never behave this way . sorry to say i will continue to avoid this shop ! !

0,"this place is worse than the irs , at least the irs admits when they made a mistake . but these arrogant workers will be caught dead before they hear themselves say sorry for the inconvenience or we made a mistake . they gave me different information on two consecutive visits that i made , then dorrie , some lady who obviously should not have been working that day because she was coughing phlegm all over my documents , then after she asked me to wait by the counter for minutes while their system updated . i waited , hour and minutes later i finally went to the information counter and asked for dorrie . . . i was told that she had gone to lunch minutes ago and was told to go talk to another lady . she just dismissed me and i went to go talk to the new lady , who was also extremely rude and kept rolling her eyes and interrupting me before i could finish my sentences . basically i spent total of and a half hours waiting and getting attitude and nothing was resolved because of their mis information and dorries idiot customer service ethics and the last ladys pride . . not one person resolved anything and they all were too proud to say we apologize for the inconvenice . i recommend this place if you wanna be late to work or more hours and having your mild mannered patience tested to the maximum .

0,"the ambience is a feast for the eyes and for the touch , this much is true , but one is paying a very high price for this exclusivity . while i liked waiting in the lobby couldn t sit at the sushi counter until it was open for dinner service at p i did notice that for a venue that strives to project a life of luxury , housekeeping hadn t come by to clean food debris off of the coffee table closest to the sushi restaurant s host desk . not even when a rep came by to alert me to a bar menu sitting on the table and asked me if i had wanted anything from the bar she had to have noticed the mess ? ! i ordered a . spider roll soft shelled crab , a veggie tempura app , and a baked lobster roll , all priced at for one week during their year anniversary . they re all good , and factoring in the ostentatious surroundings , i d pay . for the soft shelled crab roll , but i d put my foot down on the other two . maybe , but for a five piece lobster roll ? yes , it was very tasty , and yes , the cream sauce was orgasmic , but for , i expect moments from the restaurant scenes of the ugly truth or when harry met sally , take your pick . if you ve money to burn or have someone else paying for the bill , then this is your sushi stop near old town scottsdale .

0,"i m not impressed with their medium to high priced menu . sushi is never cheap , but the quality of the sushi rolls and presentation is a bit messy and not impressive for the high end decorated type of restaurant . i ve had way better quality , presentation , and taste at other sushi restaurants that are not high end . i guess we were paying for the ambiance and decorations more than anything .

1,"this is a brand new delicatessen who s grand opening was september th . since i don t have a kitchen in my place , this re heat one stop shop near my neighborhood will be a place i plan to frequent via walking . they have a cute cook book lounge and the deli layout is fun to just paroose . their chocolate chip cookies taste home made . so nice to still feel like you have some input in the cooking preparation process when you live with just a microwave .

0,"arrived around pm one wednesday evening . the place is not in a nice area of phoenix , and it looked deserted , and i was going to leave , when i saw a mercedes and lexus pull up . so i thought i d give it a chance . the prices were somewhat reasonable , i got the lo lo s for waffles , and pieces of fried chicken . the food was tasty for what it was , but i only give it s because its just so unhealthy . . kool aid , waffles , syrup , and fried chicken ! this is the kinda a place i may go once a year , but i just feel so guilty ! not sure what the syrup was , but it certainly wasn t real maple syrup i d imagine it is some sugar based creation , and the waffles were dry . the chicken wasn t very moist , it was also a bit on the dry side .

0,"meh . maybe it was just that we decided to dine in minutes prior to closing , but i was definitely not impressed . i had not been here in ages . probably years , maybe . no exaggeration . i remember nothing but good things about miracle mile . i remember being excited to come eat here . so one night while shopping at arrowhead with a friend , i got a sudden craving for a pastrami sandwich with coleslaw and thousand island dressing . i was very excited to walk in and find that it was on the menu ! i didn t have to special order it ! it was a good size sandwich . big enough that when cut in half , you still have to use both hands . i took my first bite and was immediately disappointed . not that it was bad . it s just that i had fond memories of this place and i was really expecting something near the level of perfection of the at langer s in downtown l . a . . . . . or at the least like gandolfo s in tempe . nope . it was nowhere near as good as either restaurant . it was just okay . the bread had a slight toughness like it was day old bread . the meat was chewy and lacking flavor . the coleslaw was really good and had the perfect crunch . the flavor of the coleslaw was not strong , but still masked the flavor of the pastrami . i will stick with jason s or heidi s next time i have a hankerin for another deli style sandwich .

0,"my significant other had a off coupon from restaurant . com lol . that could sum up the whole trip . i haven t been to many restaurants that participate with restaurant . com that are decent at all . i mean , i wasn t expecting much coming into this place , i shouldn t have expected anything here . i was in the mood for some red meat , and sushi places do actually have decent dishes like teriyaki chicken and stuff like that sometimes . so , i didn t mind checking this place out since i do like a little bit of sushi on the side . the boolgogee , plain , simply plain . there was a salad with the boolgogee , but it too was plain . there wasn t nearly enough meat to warrant a price tag of , because the salad and rice probably didn t cost more than . to make . oh , the sushi ? all of the sushi we happened to get were either super plain or super spicy . by spicy , i mean that there were just too many tastes going on at the same time and it was too overwhelming . i tried a few bites of the different rolls we got . after i tried each roll i thought that i liked it but that the taste was too overwhelming for me to want to try another bite . we paid for the food even after the coupon , and i honestly think that even at the price it might be a bit of a rip off considering you can get cheaper , higher quality sushi at teharu . this place is a rip off for sushi in my opinion . its not good enough to warrant the hefty price tag . the sad part is that the interior is very well done , if the food was actually good this place would be extremely interesting .

1,"fable iii used and looks brand new for ? ! oh yeah ! i ll take it ! i stumbled upon this place because our little cousin wanted to get a game , and he had been here before with his aunt . the place was filled with classic games all over the walls and even to play . i m guessing classic original games are back and in style again . plus they are just fun to try or have a flashback from the s . the store is clean , open aisles to walk through , great prices on the games and the customer service from gary and rich is phenomenal . these guys were very nice , educated about the games , and went out of there way to make everyone happy . great job guys ! all the high star reviews are true ! this place is so much better than any other gaming place i ve been too . my husband loved it too . he was a kid in a candy store . what a great find ! i think you should take a trip to this store , even if you don t play . get a game as a gift . just to experience this place , it is something special and unique .

1,the whole market is awesome . i like that if you did not bring enough cash with you that you can pick up a blue ticket at the information booth that the vender will stamp then hold your items for you then you may pay by credit card at the information table where you picked up your ticket . the veg are great . the free range eggs are the best . the french baker from tucson is pretty darn good . this market is for sure one of the better ones i have seen . worth any one checking out . note support your local produce and growers farmers . support organic ! ! one more note this information and option has to do with the farmers market out side open on the weekend from am to am
0,"ok , i usually write longer more intricate reviews about a restaurant but for this new establishment i will summerize . . great decor and ambience would be better minus the flat screens . friendly service but needs more training with food and knowledge of . timing of kitchen if a table has two or more persons , food should come out at the same time or around the same time . especially when they are not sharing . . food if you specialize in spring rolls , please make sure they are rolled up proficiently . it needs to be tight , not loose flavors are good , but there could be a variation of sauce for the spring rolls . rotating flavors for over rolls is not a good ratio . . pricing is not bad for some items , but i do agree with other reviews that for most items , the pricing is a little high for the neighborhood biz and the quality of food offered . overall , nice place to hang with friends for a drink and nibble before the actual dinner somewhere else . i will give it a few more months for an update . this place has potential , but not well executed . when opening a restaurant , you should be ready and able to . if you are not , you should wait til the staff is well trained . i believe the owner or chef is inexperience . hopefully , it will improve . . . get to work guys ! !

0,"well the view is obvious . i mean it is decently high up and gives you a good view of downtown but , i don t know the view from the arizona club is better . we went here after watching a show at the herberger and i was expecting some high class expensive dining that that is exactly what i got . the service matched the price tag which was nice to see but the restaurant itself was disappointing . not only did they not have coke or dark rum but they let poor ashley a order a prime rib and then told her they were all out . i had the drunken shrimp and they were pretty excellent . the sauce around them was really good and they were resting on a piece of toast disguised as a crostini . i also had a few bites of the lava cake but since it was buried under a pound of powered sugar , i couldn t eat any more . i guess i just agree with beth s s review . . . i m just not seeing what justifies the price . the district in the sheraton next door is a restaurant in a hotel that has amazing food that is priced better than this . plus , the view there isn t half bad .

1,"hey , its difficult to find anything particularly wrong with this stadium , which is especially remarkable coming from an obstinate sports fan who intends to hate before he loves . immediate impressions of the stadium are that it is very well designed and constructed with fan comfort in mind . chase nails this aspect solidly . the concourse are rife with eating and drinking options . you literally cannot walk steps without tasty , delicious stadium food beckoning your fat ass to indulge polish dogs , ice cream , oz . bottled beer peter fucking piper pizza mmmmmm ! . the concourse also opens up brilliantly into the field of play , and one can go take a break from the seats but still have the ability to watch the action on the field . very important feature , particularly with baseball where sitting down can become monotonous . the actual field of play is marvelously constructed , with modern and classic designs colliding . the dirt path from the mound to the plate is a throwback to the s , while the pool in the outfield adds a very unique and arizona touch . pretty damn cool . the classic clockface in centerfield is beautiful , and the grade of the stands are perfect for the noise to reflect off the metal structure . now that its under new management , they are opening the roof much more , which is a huge plus . many fans have been complaining about the lack of open air since the stadium opened . so two things that i don t like about the stadium , one ornamental , the other functional . first , the hokey , s esque mosaic on the outfield slats . jesus . how about an update ? its just looks so fucking bad , its almost embarrassing , and has prevented the outside of this architectural masterpiece from aging with grace . how about huuuge pictures of current players , or true windows to let the light in and perhaps a view of the distant skyline ? this would require , of course , for phx to actually knock down the garage mahal and actually build an outfield skyline . this leads me to problem , the aforementioned garage mahal , the most deplorable , atrocious boner yet for our mentally ill city planners and officials . what a total fucking waste to build the most useless and overly enormous parking garage that ultimately discourages people from walking through downtown before and after the game , restricted the potential for bars and restaurants to be placed there instead fuck , they didn t even give the option for ground level retail , and mostly sits at capacity on non baseball days . that would be days of uselessness . though this isn t the d backs fault , it is a result of stadium proximity , so as a penalty , combined with those silly mosaics , it loses a star and red pigment . overall , however , chase field is the tits and will eventually be a mlb classic .

0,"the chicken burger with jerk sauce was gross . it was dried out with terrible flavor . the only saving grace was that it was small , which says enough right there . as another reviewed said , it was a ground chicken patty when i was expecting a grilled chicken breast after going to places like johnny rockets where i believe they have a similarly named section of the menu that refers to chicken breast sandwiches . i realize i have myself to blame on that misunderstanding , but it was still a terrible sandwich .

1,"yumm yumm yumm ! the burgers are fantastic and yummy ! the service has always been top notch , fast and freindly . love the inside and outside environment . could do without the tvs with sports playing on them . . . don t we get enough plugged in entertainment in our lives already ? . . . . but i m probably in the minority . kid friendly for those well behaved kids of course .

1,great surprise i have driven by this place several times food was excellent i had the enchantment platter just the right amount of heat without being overwhelming cool cave like atmosphere inside and fun patio area i will definitely be back and bring out of towners

1,"this is my parents favorite place to eat when they come to phoenix so we dropped by twice on our family vacation . the owner proprietress convinced my mom in mandarin to let her pick the dishes for our first dinner so we didn t even know what would be coming . the cold smoked duck was sooo delish as was the special mountain leafy green with bean curd shreds all minced fine and not on the regular menu . there was also a shredded pork dish with bamboo excellent and a pickled vegetable with fish soup . the soup wasn t really my thing because it was heavily seasoned with white pepper which i hate but the rest of my family said it was exceptional . our second visit was for lunch before heading off to the airport for the return trip . i could have eaten the entire scallion pancake myself as well as the cold spicy pork belly dish . luckily , we ordered two orders of fried potstickers because those were delicious as well . we also had some tasty steamed pork buns but i was stuffed at that point . if you really want to experience authentic shanghai food , let the staff order for you , you won t regret it .

0,"i stumbled upon this friday s while walking around phoenix on a sunday afternoon . i wanted to just go up and have a drink and then take some pictures of the empty baseball field . phoenix was completely empty ! when i got closer to chase field there were some more people and i realized that there was a game going on ! i didn t think i would be able to get into friday s because of the game however , it wasn t very busy ! i sat at the bar since i was by myself . but once i was there awhile , i noticed there were still tables open looking out into the ballpark . so basically you get to watch the game for free as long as you are ordering stuff . i thought that was pretty cool . as for the food drink . . . i ordered a daiquiri when i sat down . it was pretty bad . almost too slushy . i looked through the menu and asked if they had any smaller portions or lunch portion . i was told that since it was a game day they have a different menu and everything is larger . so i didn t order any food . the service was good . the waiter was nice and another waitress named kimmy even came up and talked to me for a little while . i d definitely come here again just for the view .

1,"this place has a great location . hidden away in old town next to the art park of scottsdale . perfect place to take an out of towner . i suggest sitting outside . they have misters , of course , and umbrellas . inside is just a little too cramped for me . portions are huge ! not complaining . you are def . getting your moneys worth . on weekends make sure to come early this place gets packed out ! overall , a great breakfast brunch place and good place to get rid of your hangover ! . . . plus being a georgia girl pbr tall boys woop woop"
0,"this mimi s is near the reach complex where we were attending a tournament . so , afterwards , we came here . the short version is that this is just like the mimi s in chandler . the food is fine . not great , but fine . the service was ok too . everyone enjoyed their food i had the chicken pot pie . none of it really struck me as french , which is mimi s motif , but it was good . in fact , the kid had chicken picatta , which is italian . not french . they do have quiche , so maybe that s enough to claim to be a french like bistro ? ? ? not in my book , honestly . anyway , i d call this place average . really , i should give it . stars , but that s not an option with yelp . an ok place to stop if you re in the area and looking for food . you could do much worse .

0,"i agree with chris l . i was disappointed with the cafe . granted , i was looking for a college type coffeehouse where i could grade papers , and this place just didn t have that sort of lounge y feel that even certain starbuck have . there was no background music being played , and even with my ipod headphones on , i was distracted by nearby conversations . i got much more work done at roots near campus .

1,"i can t believe i didn t write a review of metro after my first visit but i got a second chance last saturday night with dottsy z , andrea k and company . we had a reservation for pm for of us , and at pm andrea asked us to add guests and when dottsy called metro they said of course , but please be advised you may have a little wait for the larger table . which leads me to the only bad point of the evening we had to wait one and a half hours for our larger table . we had all expected and accepted a minute wait . after about we went to the bar to get some wine and oysters otter creeks yummmm . after an hour had passed and no one had come to address the situation with our group , i approached the hostess and she was very apologetic and offered to comp our bar tab , which was incredibly nice . when we were finally seated our server was friendly and attentive and had gorgeous blue eyes . hello ! we were all starving and got right to the point with our orders i started with the cucumber soup and no amount of yums or mmmmms can fully describe the delight that was set before me . a cold soup , this is made with cucumbers , buttermilk , dill and olive oil , with chunks of lump crabmeat and a dollop of caviar thrown on top , because why the hell not ? ! also , the soup came in a really large bowl and i was full by the time i finished it . i did soldier on to my main course which was the moules frites which is what i had the first time i came here and is a truly inspired dish with juicy fresh mussels , and a broth with thyme , garlic and perhaps a little white wine . then to add insult to injury they serve the huge casoulet with a hearty portion of herbed french fries that were the perfect crispness and didn t leave oil on my hands . sadly i had to leave some of those friends behind , but only because it was time for dessert ! i chose pot de creme which is normally topped with brioche . i requested a brioche free pot and it was no problem . i was served a tiny ramekin of creamy custard topped with a sort of peanut butter syrup creme and three slices of caramelized banana . it was really yummy though within minutes my heart was racing from all the sugar . i will point out that this dinner took full hours we left at pm making this the longest i ever spent in a restaurant . hours are you kidding me ? which is why i ultimately docked one star . based on food alone metro brasserie deserves stars .

0,"this is my first time using groupon . it s one way to enjoy various cultural experiences without investing too much money just in case . obviously the restaurant can well benefit from the exposure without costing them too much . it s voucher that i ve paid ahead . the restaurant only got i believe . and i did yelp ! extensively before hitting the buy button . i understand that it s hard to find authentic foods in usa . everything is americanized for one reason or the other . most americans i know not those that i don t know can t handle strange taste , texture , weirdness , repulsion , and various dislikes . and i know that it s hard to get the same fresh or processed ingredients and spices from home countries . those are my pet peeves alright . and there is one more before i get onto the review . comparison can be deadly . i have tried latin american foods including yucatan , oaxaca , belizean . so my knowledge is nil on venezuelan foods . but i do have taste buds and experiences from various food cultures . overall . it sucked . i was referring to the taste , variety , and uniqueness . it didn t worth my dime . my friend and i had the media bandeja the regular portion for . the big plates came with big serving of steamed white rice , small cups of black beans sprinkled with cheese , half an ordinary avacado , fried eggs chinese style , i cooked that all the time , plain arepas round flat breads , one chorizo sausage , one blood sausage , scopes of shredded beef , one small steak , few green plantains , and few sweet plantains . the blood sausage tasted like burned tired . i had blood pudding much tastier and smoother and more colorful that that . i grew up with blood pudding . yummy ! ! ! that maybe the reason that i m vicious now . heed my warning , it s not good for cholesterol . the steak had tasty flavor it s ordinary though . i believe it s oz shrunk to oz . the shredded beef reminds me of sloppy joe . it s ok for the taste . the sweet plantains are regular fried plantains as found in some chinese buffets or regular dessert menu . it s good for the sweetness but nothing more than that in this restaurant . if you give me a steam bun or silver thread roll both are steamed rice dough , i can tell how much salt it contains , the chewing satisfaction , the freshness , and the steamed distinct aroma . and i can eat it plain . arepas ? what s that ? it s an tasteless , odorless , chewy carb that didn t excite my taste buds a bit . boring ! ! ! honestly , i had no clue how special it was supposed to be . it tasted better after i stuffed avocado and shredded beef inside . the green plantains were like hard cardboard . fried carb without taste , but it has a green tinted color . my friend also ordered tequenos fried breaded cheese sticks . . . really tiny for each . chinese egg rolls each are twice as big and they are greaser and tastier . i ain t a size queen . the empanada ham queso was so tiny with bite size for . come on . . . are you kidding me ! ! ! calzones are more complicated and much bigger with ham and cheese and more ingredients , for similar price . again , i ain t a size queen . my point is that it s so ordinary that i couldn t see the cost value especially for bandeja . i can serve up the same plates at home with minimal cost . i know the restaurant needs to earn money for cooking , serving , paying wages , and renting the space . we were the only table that night . the wait service was ordinary . . . between a bus boy and minimalist . the ambient was plain . . . and not a place you expect to pay for two before groupon . so diners , i enjoy a chance to have a different cultural experience . you should give it a try . due to a lack of familiarity , the foods tasted bland and boring . i don t feel like gaining any new knowledge except a few words on the foods . i feel like they were serving home cooked meals or peasant foods as ambrosia and they charged accordingly . that s my problem with this restaurant . and i have a totally different experience than the yelpers here .

1,was here awhile back and sharon h s review will sum it for atmosphere but i will try and cover my feelings on the taste . the bruchetta is great . yeah really that simple . i haven t tried much but bruchetta here but haven t really been disappointed either . even the ones that haven t been a fan of of the ones i tried when i have mixed and matched when getting to select i still would order over bruchetta at most places as they are still very good . did try a pizza once and wasn t amazed but nothing stood out it s been awhile since that . the bruchetta however comes to mind every time i hear the word . oh and the service is very friendly and attentive . one night i was in and they had just finished a major catering event and it had said on the front door that the kitchen was going to be slow until about the time we arrived . yet when we ordered and it took a bit to get the food barely a delay in my book and if i hadn t been apologized to by the waiter probably wouldn t have know it was longer than normal we got a nice little discount . 
1,"my husband and i have been going to the touch of thai for years . we meet up there at least twice a month for a lunch date . on special occasions we take friends and family there for dinner . i love the wait staff especially nick ! his wonderful sarcasm and jokes always make our day ! for the amount of food you get at lunch at the price they charge you can t beat it . everything is homemade and tastes fresh . yellow curry is my hubby s favorite . rich coconut based sauce with yellow curry . the chicken is tender and the potatoes and carrots are cooked perfectly . i venture off and try things from time to time . the food is spicy . i like the incorporation of fresh herbs into the dishes . the soup served with lunch is always yummy and changes from time to time . we always get a side order of spring rolls . you need to try these ! i like the pad thai as well as the and lunch specials . meals are served fairly quickly . sometimes we have to get up and refill our own water glasses however i find this to be a wee bit charming . feels like i am home . if you go there on a regular basis the servers remember you , have your order into the kitchen before you even are seated , and always say hello and smile .

0,"this is a tough one . it s probably the best filipino restaurant in the phoenix area . but that s not saying much , because the few there are here are really not good . compare jeepney bistro to one of the places in filipino town los angeles , and they get blown away . and , for the record , my wife is a filipina . and she cooks much better than the chef here . no contest . a lot less grease fat oil , that s for sure ! ! also , their portions are a bit small . bigger than a few other places i could name , but still small . if you really want some filipino food , and you don t know my wife to beg some from her , this is probably your best option without driving to la . but don t form your opinion of filipino food based on this place . go to la and try bahay kubo natin , or some others , and you ll get a much better idea of what the cuisine is about !

1,"this place was unique for me because everyone seemed like they were inside smoking but it was an indoor outdoorish place . there were heated lights and it was the only place that i found pretty crowded where if you walked the streets there weren t a lot of people . the food was good , i had the steak fajita , which you can t go wrong because its just steak . but i also had a fish taco which was pretty good . my boyfriend had the pick three meal , so he picked tacos , chimichanga , and enchilada . his choice was good and the chimichanga was delish . the bathrooms were very rustic looking but it seemed to look that way , decent for a funky place like that . they had live music friday night , where a guy was doing bad covers on a few good songs . the waitstaff was overall nice and they checked back at us here and there . overall i d go back if i was in around scottsdale again !

1,"love it here . i stay at hotels about nights a year for work , and often go to phoenix . gotta say , if it weren t for the hood neighborhood , i would ve given it stars . the restaurant next door , bobby q , has rave reviews , so it seems like a convenient place to eat , but that seems to be the only dinner place around . good thing it s the residence inn , with a small kitchenette . this is probably the cleanest hotel i ve stayed in all year . the dishes and silver wear are very clean and housekeeping keeps it that way daily . i ve stayed at places twice the amount of this residence inn in scottsdale and dishes in the kitchenette were filthy . small workout room but you can go to the la fitness down the street for free . oh , they don t skimp on breakfast waffles , eggs , sausage , yogurt , fresh fruit and hot and cold cereal . beds don t look comfy but they are devine . i had some of my best nights sleep here . it s nice to stay at a place that is more like a home than a hotel .

0,"i love saddle ranch for its casual night time festivities including watching people ride the mechanical bull hehehe , but i cannot ignore the fact that the food was disgusting ! when i think of my meal this past friday night , i think of two words dry and cold . the spinach artichoke dip was just okay a bit on the dry side and not very cheesy . the onion rings were just okay was well as the batter reminded me of the chicken nuggets at mcdonald s , maybe even worse . the bbq burger turkey patty was dry and tasteless as was the bacon . really ? it must take true talent to cook bacon tasteless . there are a few things that the menu has going for itself a few very unique and fun desserts and drinks that i have yet to see elsewhere . i am fond of the giant pile of cotton candy and , though i m not much of a beer drinker , the beer tower looks pretty badass . for me , i came and will continue to come for the fun atmosphere , but i will definitely be staying away from the grub . adios , cowboy .

1,"like they even need another review they have a solid stars as it is ! just got back from my first visit to adobe , and i am beyond impressed . my german shepherd pup was having some stomach issues over the holidays , so i decided to have him checked out to be on the safe side . i knew he didn t have an obstruction or other emergency issue , but i was concerned about parasites . the receptionist , hilary , was super sweet on the phone and in person . she was upfront with what tests she thought would be ordered , and how much it would run me and it wasn t an arm and a leg the office call was only . i was very happy they d be able to see me the next morning , but then she called back not minutes later with a cancellation and said to come on in . even better ! the tech was very good with nately s pounds of squirming , and loved on him the whole time . i was also happy they let me help hold him i ve been to vets that called in a nd tech , like the owners aren t capable of safely holding their own dog . okay , maybe some aren t , but i am , and i appreciate being able to and not being instructed like a child . dr . newland was awesome . the difference between him and some other vets i ve been to ? other vets oh my god , we need to run worth of expensive tests and start him on multiple medications , general sense of admonishment for not rushing him to their affiliated er clinic , eagerness to run the bill up , very few questions about anything , etc . . . dr . newland super calm and personable . he spent minutes going over everything nately s last few days of activity and stomach issues , diet , contact with other dogs , where i take him in public , anything he could think of really , felt his abdomen thoroughly , and said honestly , he s a puppy , they eat funny things , and something probably just irritated his stomach . he s plainly feeling pretty good , so just feed him a bland diet , give him this medication to settle his stomach , and bring a stool sample just in case , so you know for sure he s parasite free . he also dispensed advice for nately s general care , as long as we were there , about heartworm prevention and necessary vaccines , etc . i even got a good education on the different types of parasites and which were even likely in az s climate turns out , not many . i really appreciated that he didn t try to frighten me into expensive diagnostics and possible serious diseases , and that he is so on his game and scientific logical about things . i am very impressed and will be making adobe my regular vet for as long as possible . if only they treated birds too !

1,"sitting at the counter at fnb is an experience that should be had , period . our reservations by default was later on in the evening , but also turned out to be quite fortuitous . not only were we able to see chefs badman and curry in action , but also saw them turn down the kitchen towards the end of the night . it is a display that even the most advent epicurean is not often exposed to . there are no doors or walls to hide behind . everything that you eventually place in your mouth is out in the open and also in the way it is prepared from the raw , to the stove , to the plate . impressive was also how fluid the kitchen moved with only the two chefs preparing dishes . chef curry preparing the appetizers , fish and fowl while chef badman shoveled coal onto a grill and simultaneously manning it to ensure rib eyes were cooked to order . the ambiance was the type you d expect when invited into another s kitchen , and the food tasted as if given the same attention . so to the service . our waitress , chantelle was nice about explaining everything to us after hearing that it was our first time there . when she found out we had moved just a few months ago , she was kind enough to write down her restaurant recommendations for us too . will definitely be back to try other items off their ever evolving menu . reservation for two please . yes its okay if its at the counter and yes , its fine if its late .

0,"jason b . and i decided to try this place on saturday night . i looked at the menu online and though the food sounded really interesting . we started with the artichoke croquettes , and the calamari as well . we were disappointed in the artichoke croquettes , you get half artichokes fried with alternating marinara and this white sauce . the only thing that was good about this dish was the white sauce , which we used to dip the calamari in . the calamari was your average calamari , nothing special ! i ordered a the th street burger , which was cooked perfectly and came with a spicy sauce , not sure if the sauce was for the onion rings , but it was great of the burger . not sure i will be rushing back to the armadillo grill , but i wouldn t say no to going back again !

1," cut to scene friday night , lounging around discussing the lameness of the evening , ready to indulge in a new adventure . six pack of newcastle sits untouched in fridge and bellys aching for fulfillment . yelp . com search reveals a local japanese eatery nearby . enter , hana . first off , pre game excitement for this byob , local , fresh sushi spot . newcastle in hand , my friend and i strutted in here at around pm on a mildly warm friday night . the place is jammed , and a couple parties stand around waiting for tables . great , a long wait . nope , two seats open at the bar . sat down , and our beer was immediately taken and put in a fridge to ensure it wouldn t lose any of it s remarkably smooth quality . first beer is poured , and the excitement ensues . friendly and welcoming server devluges us in the specials , and unfortunately they were out of most of their fish as they have been for three weeks . toro and salmon were our options , so we went with a special for the night , the spider roll , and the vegas roll . also , edamame to start . the food was superb . the edamame came spicy with a side of chili flakes and siracha for our never ending quest to burn the shit out of our mouths . a second round of newcastle was brought upon when our first was finished , and the sushi came shortly thereafter , looking like little pieces of art . both sets of rolls were enormous and came about to a plate . the vegas roll was packed with cream cheese , avocado , and salmon . the special roll , the spider roll , was full of crispy soft shell crab and just enough spicy ness for a much needed kick in the mouth . one dip in my wasabi soy sauce concoction was more than enough . our third and final beer was poured by an overly anxious and over stimulated , presumably newbie , bus boy . i had about inches of head on my beer and my friend got hers spilled and nearly twice as much head . he excellent waitress we had made up for this guys slips during the meal . the staff wished us a nice farewell on our way out , and i felt as though i had just left a very close friend s house . i will definitely be back with more six packs and good friends to share this little diamond in the rough with .

0,"alright , so how does it go from being a star actually , less than that to being a star review ? simple , they seem better than the last time i was working shopping here . i went here the other night to help my boyfriend find an interview outfit and noticed that the store had a handful of the same employees as they did back in the summer , but certain areas of clothing had been moved around . despite all the moving and switching around they must have done , the store seemed really clean and in order . in fact , i really have no issues with this store except one , teeny tiny , little problem . . . the check out girl ! i remember her from when i worked here and she gave me attitude when i needed to ask her something . turns out , it wasn t a one time thing . . she s just a rude person . on this particular night , there were only two check out girls and a line of about people . my boyfriend and i were making seperate purchases and knew one of us was going to get her . i happened to get the friendly one , but before we each paid for our items , we were watching as the rude girl didn t crack even one half hearted attempt at a smile . we listened as she rudely explained to some elderly ladies why a certain item was marked on sale but the same item was normal priced . they wanted to make sure they weren t paying too much too little and her explanation ? that ones been the store longer . it didn t make sense to them , or to those of us in line watching , but she kept getting huffy about it until they dropped the issue . she shoved people s items in bags and practically threw them at them and said , again without trying to fake some kind of customer service , have a good night . bye . next ! yuck . my cashier was slightly more frienldy , but still not awesome . it was obvious she was having a long night afterall , she was stuck at the register with the ice queen , so it was understandable . also , i didn t catch her name , but the girl working in the dressing rooms was really sweet and kept greeting everyone that came by . i had to call this location to get the name of the manager for something i was filling out on a form and i was told they ve got a new manager . thus , i know why this jumped up two stars . it could have been four , but certain things they haven t fixed rude cashier girl have kept this review at a solid three .

1,"love this place ! i went with my grandma and aunt on a thursday afternoon . the weather was great but just a tad windy so we sat inside . first i like the layout of this place , very open and airy . there are outside patios one street level and then one upstairs . i actually have been here twice so far . first time was just for a mid afternoon cocktail with one of my stylists . the servers were very friendly and our concoction of vodka , grapefruit and cranberry juice was the perfect blend . the second time we ordered small plates to share , ahi tacos , artichoke and spinach dip and the mussels . all three were heavenly and very reasonably priced . the ahi was fresh and chilled , perfect for a warm day . the artichoke dip was different than any i have had before , gooey cheesy goodness that we gobbled up practically licking the bowl . the chips that accompanied the did were fresh and perfectly salted , even when the dip was done we still polished off the chips . the mussels were in a perfect white wine sauce but the stars of this dish were the mussels themselves . buttery and melt in your mouth good , not chewy at all with no grit , to most common problem i find . the broth was so good i let the bread marinate at the bottom of the bowl , soaking up the juice . my martini was a generous pour and even though they were out of blue cheese stuff olives the bartender took the time to stuff some and deliver it to our table . now on to the staff , all are a good looking lot but they are also skilled . all of our food and drinks were delivered in a timely manner by our lovely server jennifer . we also met one of the sous chefs , lennie . a charming fellow with stunning blue eyes , my grandmother remarked on them , a playful mohawk and tattoos peaking out of his uniform . he swears that the sweet potato fries are some of the best in town and sent over a complimentary bucket . i do believe he is right , cooked to perfection , slightly crisp on the outside , warm and soft on the inside dusted with fresh herbs and i believe parmesan cheese . after our meal the manager came over to make sure everything was to our liking . rnr is another great place within walking distance from my salon and i am looking forward to trying everything on their menu . if all the items are as wonderful as the first i tried i am in for a treat !

1,"when cowboys ride off into the sunset , they probably stop at greasewood flat for a burger and beer . this rustic little bar is located a bit outside the city right near pinnacle peak and is definitely worth the drive ! you ll know you are in the right spot when you see the antique farm equipment and suddenly feel like you are walking up to an old west saloon . say hello to the mule on your way in . outside they have picnic tables , horseshoes , and fire pits gets chilly out there in the desert ! , and on the weekends they have live music and dancing . inside , the bar is pretty small , and the place is covered in dollar bills and business cards left by satisfied cowboys and cowgals . for the nights without live music , don t you fret , they have a jukebox with tons of country hits . the night we went it was the bartender s birthday , and the regulars were definitely having a good time . both a historic landmark year old original stagecoach stop and a dive bar , greasewood flat is clearly special to arizona , and is a definite must see . i ll be going back on a weekend to get the true greasewood flat experience and hopefully see a cute cowboy or two . .

0,good service . the waitress was friendly . but the food was just icky and the place smelled bad ! like sewage pipes . i had a glass of wine . there was no way i was going to order a mixed drink while she was tearing the bar down . i didnt feel good after eating the food . i had a coupon so it made the total bill cheap . but i would have walked out if i had to pay full price because the atmosphere they boast should provide better food . no not good dont go
0,i would rather go to benihana to be honest . i have been here a few times because its so convenient but has never been worth it in the end . i have eaten here and had dinner to go it always takes forever and it is not cheap i expect cheaper if theres no atmosphere or really good food would make up for it . i have not gotten sick from the sushi here but lets just say i didnt feel so hot after eating here the last time . i looooove sushi and its hard to say that i wont be back here but i d rather drive a bit farther and skip running the risk . 
1,this place is awesome . just bought a loose super powers darkseid . will def be back for more . lots of loose figures . great prices and friendly staff . 
0,"until they get their quality under control , we won t eat here except for lunch . we ate here last weekend and both had the roasted chicken . the problem was it tasted like it was basted in cinnamon and the sauce for the risotto had at least whole peppercorns on each of our plates . i actually bit into to one before i realized that the sauce was just crawling with them . they could ve strained them out , processed them in , whatever , just don t serve me a plate with a bunch of whole peppercorns . this tasted nothing like the previous visit when i ordered the same exact dish . when we finally let the management know that our food was unacceptable , he said the best he could do was a discount . well . we weren t looking for a free or discounted meal , but rather some acknowledgement that they actually cared about the food . that never happened . unless something changes , the burgers are decent and that is about it .

1,"great service . tasty food . i like it for lunch because later , i can skip dinner . their salad bar satisfies the vegetarian taste buds . i like this place alot . i think it lives up to the hype . "
1,"pretty cool place that appeals to very different crowds . my friends and i stayed downstairs for the majority of the night . the hip hop music was pretty good and the dj had a excellent music selection . the bartenders were very friendly , except for one of the blonde girls . when i put my empty beer bottle on the bar , she took it and i raised my hand to say thank you for taking it . then she came back with another beer that i didn t order , and i think she got a little pissed because she misunderstood me . at the end of the night , i asked for some water and she only gave me a bottle instead of just a cup of tap water and charged me . don t be a hater lady ! ! get a shot of cafe patron ! ! ! if you like coffee and patron , it s literally the best of both worlds . and , to top it all off , they are only a shot ! ! very reasonably priced . i had within a span of an hour i m a heavyweight so i wouldn t recommend that for everyone ! upstairs , they have techno house music and it s packed like no other . the people are really cool though . they have friendly battles and it s pretty cool to just watch them for about minutes . depending on your scene , you can pick either floor .

1,my favorite place in the world to eat ! great service and awesome food ! 
1,"we have been meaning to try the mission for awhile , and we were extremely impressed . we are self professed foodies , good cooks , etc . let s start with the fact that they seated us promptly at our reservation time , and that reservation had only been made that day . . . . . surprising , because the place was packed ! ! alfonso was our waiter , and he was awesome and didn t hesitate to make suggestions that we were happy to add to our dinner . first , the margaritas . . . . . this place knows how to pour , and they are fresh the only way we will drink them . next there are only places in phoenix that can make good table side guacamole , and this is the best of them . alfonso suggested a fried pork belly cola reduction appetizer that i had to be talked into . omg . . . . heaven , and such a complex blend of flavors that the sweet , crunchiness of the pork belly can only be described as worth it if you are balking at the issue of pork belly . entree we chose the chorizo porchetta and the scallops . both were excellent and may i say that the timing of each course was unbelievably prompt . we never waited and yet didn t feel rushed . dessert i confess that i read the dessert menu first before making dinner decisions , and while other reviews loved the selections . . . i wasn t blown away . the churros were small and dough y , and the milkshake was just to heavy sweet after a meal . . . . . better to fill the churros with a cheese and serve them warm on dulce de leche ice cream . fried bananas didn t excite me either . bananas are bananas . . . . . the pumpkin bread pudding seemed heavy and autumn like for a degree day in arizona and did not compliment the latin flavors of the dinner . i feel their dessert menu needs to be expanded in a way that compliments their cuisine . . . . some citrus sorbet , chocolate with red chile cake , lime cheesecake . at any rate , i still give them the full monty on stars ! ! !

0,"we have one of the st ones to open in the valley right near us and it s ok . sure it has a selection of ready to eat or grocery selections , but watch the pricing . . you somewhat understandably pay for the convience and the time savings of their ready to go s . i do like their concept and do shop there occasionally more like if i just need something quick . their hotdog buns are sorta sweet which is different , not different bad , just different ! as for the hybrid only parking . . . i don t think so . . . what a joke !

1,"i wish that this place were not so good i have not been able to drink the coffee at my office in weeks . the location that one coffee occupies used to be a coffee shop graveyard . several coffee houses went out of business in this location , unable to compete with starbucks . one coffee has bucked that trend and it is not hard to see why . one coffee has great coffee and it is amazingly consistent . the staff is always friendly . this place is certainly doing something right everytime i go in there it has more and more customers .

0,"they don t have the lunch specials on the menu or tell you about them if you don t ask , so make sure to ask . the sandwiches don t come with fries and their fries are over priced for not being very good . the pulled pork sandwich is good and so is the sauce . also , expect a long wait especially if people are ahead of you .

0,"i was searching for a unique item to give as a thank you gift and i stopped by practical art over the labor day weekend after viewing some items on their website . i was extremely under underwhelmed by the service i received and do not plan on returning . when i arrived the young woman behind the counter was having a personal conversation with an acquaintance . besides the employee and her conversation buddy the store was empty . i spent about ten minutes looking around and the young woman did not have the common courtesy to acknowledge me with a simple hello , even as i was viewing items directly in front of the counter . when i was leaving the store she did break long enough to say bye . i believe it is very important to support local business but i will not spend my money here . i did find several items i wanted to buy and made note of the artist . i have done the extra leg work to reach out to them to find out how to purchase their items through other channels . i do not feel they should miss a sale due to the sub par customer service at this location . "
0,"i should have taken my own advice and stayed far away from this place . our most recent visit ended hastily when i was served rotten tuna and got barely a sorry from the staff . i could smell that the fish had gone horribly , horribly off when the ahi tuna salad was put before me by the waiter , and i m shocked that the kitchen actually thought they d get away with sending it out . the waiter disappeared so quickly from my table that i had to go hunt him down to point out the bad smell at my table was coming from the food , and he took my plate back to the kitchen and five minutes later came back to say , okay , we all smelled it and there s definitely something wrong there . seriously ? you had to go pass it around to confirm that i m not crazy when you can clearly tell within ten seconds that this is not how raw fish should smell ? after all this , their solution was to comp an appetizer , not the salad , and eventually gave me a new salad to go , which i decided not to eat just to be on the safe side . look , i m not scared to eat week old leftovers or sushi at a divey joint and i don t really get freaked out by the cleanliness of restaurants , but this could have been dangerous . i have absolutely warned off all my coworkers and friends against this place , and now i m warning all of yelp . it could have been handled in a way that left me confident that it was just another new restaurant kink , but the awful service made it clear that s not the case and i shudder to think of what new low they ll sink to .

0,"check in was fast and quick and price was right for what it was . a big upgrade over a discount property and super close to the airport . it does resemble a different kind of hotel in that everything was outside , but the room was spacious and generally quiet . the morning breakfast was solid and the only real minus was the shuttle s delay some of the hotels came twice in the time it took this one to show up once . but save for that . . . a more than adaquate experience for an overnight stay .

0,"this review is for the chain in general . the location we went to is new so it isn t in yelp yet . once it is i will put this review there as well . we were there on friday at pm . the reason i gave it stars is because the burger was very good and it was made the way i asked for it . my husbands burger was not . but , the server and the fries left a lot to be desired . let me preface by saying that we had been to several other locations . i like my fries crispy . i ask for them well done , extra crispy , scorched , tortured hollow tubes . whatever their buzz word is for well done . the location will comply . every other guys has complied . but not the one at tatum and shea . she said that corporate said they are not to cook the fries that way . so if we were to put up with soggy fries yes soggy , then we did not want them . she also interrupted us several times which is rude . then she went and called corporate just to double check for us and she came to the table and said they said no they were not to cook them that way . seriously ? we did not ask for her to do this . she actually accused us of being undercover shoppers . we started to say something and then again she interupted . listen , if you explain that our choice is not how the company wishes to present their product and we still choose to have them a different way , you should comply . it is after all our money and our decision . i was raised with the rules that the customer is always right . and if the customer is wrong refer to rule number ! ! we will not return . they have lost our business and i hope she loses her job . if you want to try a really good burger and fries place go to paradise valley burger company at th street and bell . you will not be disappointed .

0,"i am writing this update soley based on the feeling one gets when going to spitfire grill , the food and drinks are always good . our complaint about spitfire is that the owner and staff is never very welcoming . my fiancee and i have been there times and there is never any recognition by the staff . the owner is always there and he has never introduced himself or thanked us for coming in again . the servers have never said welcome back or good to see you again . for a neighborhood restaurant i would think you would want to make your regular customers feel appreciated . we love the food and the restaurant is right around the corner from our house , but we lean toward other , farther away restaurants with a more weloming feel . for example , last night we went to house of tricks in tempe . it was our th visit . when we walked in three of the employees greeted us and welcomed us back . the bartenders remembered what we drink and asked us about something we discussed last time we were there . talk about feeling welcome ! spitfire has a lot to learn if they want to survive in a neighborhood lacation .

1,"my vintage shopping in the phoenix area has been disappointing so far . goodwill , salvation army , and savers are in their separate boat of cheap stuff that is rarely vintage . buffalo exchange shouldn t even be called vintage , because it is not . it is much more of a consignment store . most of the things are new or lightly worn and are cheaper than retail prices but more expensive than goodwill . the selection really isn t bad . i have found a few things here i am really happy with . example a sweet pair of orange high heels from steve madden i think . i don t really give a crap about brand names , i buy things because i like em , no matter the name . they were thirty bones not too cheap but probably a lot less than they would have been at the mall i am guessing , ? . its still a fun store despite the vintage confusion . everyone who works there i think gets all the good clothes first because they are always so freakin adorable ! super friendly not the fake kind either , can you believe someone is f cking the handshake in this metropolis ? . so get over there . you will find some good stuff . just don t even bother selling anything unless it is high end brand name or the best vintage find you have ever gotten and that one is even not a guarantee .

0,"i want very badly to love this bar . i really do . it has all the promising combinations of qualities i look for in a local locale . great beer . i have no qualms about ordering the french canadian hefeweizen that i can t even pronounce , spell or at this moment recall with one glass all to myself and lick my lips at many other brews on the menu . add a wine list beyond belief and liquor if its your poison too . the proximity to my own compound and the blossoming bud that is the central phoenix renaissance is always worth a gold star why commute when staying local is a better option ? the staff and owners of the sidebar are fantastic . from my induction many months ago they sling the drinks with pride and the effort in the setup and delivery of the place doesn t go unnoticed . the decor is where things start to slide . not because the place is hovel , far from it . everything is crisp and new . from the hydraulic bar stools , to the multicolored ambient lighting to the comfy lounge couches , to the super clean bathrooms this place is a slice of upper crust for those of us who don t normally even thing to nibble from such a decadent pie . herein lies the problem or as my former boozing partner visiting from his new digs in portland put it , i d like to see this place with about years worth of dust on it . not my style , but i dig it and phoenix sure as hell needs a place like it . in the end i will go back and don t mind in the slightest having a place like sidebar to show off to east valley dwellers and scottsdale brats , but every time i reach for the front door i pause and am sad . a mere few feet away lies the corpse of the beloved emerald lounge . a dark , seedy , dirty , smoke filled haven of locals , live music , art and personality that is now nothing but a painted over ghost . so please , support your local bar , bring your friends and keep the sidebar real . but remember to pause for a moment of silence and drink one to the ghost below your feet us locals will thank you .

1,"ok guys and gals too , i know size isn t everything , but omg , this place has crazy size portions and i loooove it ! we ordered the calamari and the stuffed mushrooms orders and still , the servings were huge . six big stuffed mushrooms sitting on what seemed to me to be the biggest plate i have ever seen serving an appetizer . they were great and tasty , but cooled down too quickly and who can do anything about that ? the calamari was decent , could have been spiced up a bit or served with something more than marinara sauce , but for those who don t like a lot of fan fare with their food , this would be perfect classic calamari with classic sauce . we loved the stella artois draft beer and martinis came out big and filled to the brim , just how i like them . for our entrees we ordered the baked ziti and sausage and the rigatoni d . both of them were absolutely fantastic . . . yumm . and both were huge . the baked ziti stayed warm right up until we packed the rest to take home because they actually bake it right in the ceramic type dish that they serve it in , very smart . for those with little ones , the kids menu is awesome and probably the healthiest meal a kid is going to get anywhere . nothing at this place is pre packaged or pre made and that goes for the kids meals as well . their chicken fingers are home made the pickiest of adults would eat these things ! , no french fries home made mashed potatoes and broccoli florets . this is the kids menu ! our waiter needed to be coaxed out of his shell , but he was still warm in that great way that the good ones know how to do without intruding . great leather booths , linen napkins , white table cloths with a white and red checkered one thrown on top for added warmth , elegant , but not stuffy . guys could go in with t shirts and dress shorts and fit right in and for the ladies who like to dress up , you can as well with out feeling overly so . i am definitely going here again , what a find !

0,"strange just strange . i park here when i travel out of town . i used the valet parking once last year and don t remember any issues . today was my second time . . . i dropped my car off last week . the airport shuttle was waiting for me at baggage claim when my flight landed at midnight . i went to pick up my car after a long flight as was told it s at the front , the valet guy pointed and disappeared . i was left standing alone wondering if there was another side of the hotel where my car was ? ? i walked into the lobby and the receptionist was quick to tell me there is a balance on my account . huh ? ? number one i don t have an account at the hotel and number two i didn t stay here overnight . again i m standing there thinking what is going on , is he getting my mixed up with someone else ? finally he explained the parking wasn t prepaid and i needed to pay in a order to get my car . he gave me a bit of an attitude as if i was refusing to pay . dude , it s am , i just got off a long flight didn t realize my fianc didn t prepay online when he set the whole thing up for me online . all this confusion could have been spared if the valet guy would have just said you pay at the desk instead of its at the front which is unclear and indirect . i think next time i go out of town ill try a different parking garage .

0,"when i bought my house a year ago , it came with a big , half dead front lawn . i decided to do a desert landscape out there instead , called a number of landscape contractors i found here on yelp also at the home garden show at the fairgrounds . i soon learned that this is an unprofessional industry overall . i had several company representatives never return my call to set up an appointment to come over do a survey . i had others schedule an appointment not show up . i had others come do the initial survey but never get back in touch with me with a price . one guy i called said he would look at my yard on google earth email me a survey . he never did , i guess a job didn t make it worth his while to come over for a few minutes ! i had a couple of others who got back in touch but with only a materials list . i had asked for a sketch of what they would do with my yard for all this money ! after probably more than a dozen tries , i finally had legitimate , complete surveys in hand to decide between , the price range only varied about . one of my surveys was from tom baird at creative environments . after the survey , he emailed me a materials list a cad drawing that gave me a good idea what my new yard would look like . i liked it , so i went with them . next , though , my job got handed off to another company rep , david inness . david was likable , but the job ended up changing considerably from the agreement i had with mr . baird . for instance , i was promised that a bobcat skip loader would be used to dredge down to remove the old grass before the new materials were applied . that other promises were not fulfilled . on installation day , three workers no foreman chico whom i was promised would be here came out to do the work . they didn t remove the grass at all , but rather put down some black plastic material over about half ! of the yard . i complained , one of the workers called chico on his cell phone handed it to me . chico explained to me that they weren t going to dig down , or put down any more plastic , unless i wanted to go to the hardware store buy some more myself ! i tried to call david inness , but he was unreachable . the materials included a big pile of dirt a big pile of gravel to be used for the job . the workers hand shoveled the dirt to form the contoured mounds as planned , but then only applied a very thin coating of the gravel on top , leaving most of the big pile on the driveway , and left ! that was it , they told me , that i could use the rest of the tons of gravel that i had bought in planters around the place , or if i wanted , they would have it picked up in a couple days ! after trying to call for a day or two , i finally reached david inness , who got the workers to come back over finish applying the gravel , which they did , but unevenly . the gravel depth ended up being zero to deep . i moved it around some myself to even it up , but i shouldn t have had to , since i didn t get the dig down preparation , the gravel was already skating out onto the surrounding driveway sidewalk . david had the workers now dig down a little around the edges , so that the top of the gravel would be down about an inch to stay put better . this was the worst contractor experience i have ever had in my life . the only thing saving it from a star rating is that the nice plan for the layout of the dirt plants was followed , the yard does look good now . of course i have a problem with grass coming up through the gravel , since it wasn t scooped out as promised . i attempted to kill it ahead of time with weed grass killer as directed , but all my estimators told me you really need to do both . if i had it to do over , i would have gone with michael at breese landscaping instead .

1,"i find it hilarious that someone would reference this place as being terrible , compare it to overpriced and bland humble pie , and in the same breath say it was the best chili relleno you ever tasted . i can t vouch for the chicken tacos but most street tacos are nowhere near packed with meat . by definition they are usually very tiny with onions , some guacamole , a little cabbage , and some small cuts of meat . i can say the tilapia tacos are tops large filet on each on the list of my girlfriend s quest for good fish tacos . i can say the pork nachos are the best i have had as the pork reminds me of los dos molinos in a small way . the empanadas are excellent as well . if you go for happy hour you can get two empanadas for bucks . you can also get large fish tacos for bucks . would you like some awesome tortilla soup ? bucks . if you get the dinner version of the emapanadas with a large portion of some of the best rice and a side of black beans i think it sets you back about bucks . i have also had the chili relleno and it is the best i have tasted as well leaving me to wonder with the single review you have for anything , why the venom ? i learned long ago to ask for what is recommended for before you order and if someone recommends a place try what they are harping about first . when i asked they said the chili relleno , pork , empanadas , and red sangrias . guess how my dining experience went ? try ordering tacos from los dos molinos and you will leave pissed . order the green chili pork and you will drive miles for it . i do hope you give it another chance i have honestly never had anything sub par here in my or so visits and they seriously could charge way more for quality than they do . i agree that main ingredient is great also , that s why i took the time to write about it . but to reiterate dollar for most dinner items besides new york strip on the list to try , is not pricey happy hour has most items for street tacos are not bursting with meat ask what is the best thing on the menu when you order some place then you can write it off all you want . humble pie was more pricey and not worth it , all it does is take up parking from a much better place next door . for a place with the reference to pizza in it s name you would think it would be better , it tasted like peter piper . i would love to know what a good chicken taco is in your opinion , i cant think of any besides maybe the california tacos at the now closed chuy s , but the ones my sister ordered from here were full of chicken and topped with a nice chipotle ranch like sauce which is similar .

1,"i m in love . bacon you have my heart and my stomach . after all where else does everything come with one of my favorite foods attached to it ? even my bloody mary had a slice of crisp bacon in it along with a celery spear , olives and onions . probably one of the best bloody mary s i have had in awhile . the location is a little off the beaten path which is why , i think , people are lined up to get in the breakfast club a couple of blocks away for mediocre food , and here at bacon the food and service is better and there was no line on the sunday i was there . i was seated in what they call the nook located on the side where i had full view of the restaurant . the menu was well organized and entrees come with toast and breakfast potatoes and your choice of a side of bacon or ham . you can also substitute fresh tomatoes if that is your wish . the food came up quickly and was delicious ! my ham and cheese omelet was perfectly done all melted cheese and ham inside and firm eggs on the outside and the side of bacon was crisp and tasty . given the size , this easily was a egg omelet . breakfast with drinks ran about which was cheap for all the food i got . but i would be remiss if i didn t talk about what really blew me away about this place . it s the fantastic service ! everyone seems to be part of a larger team . i was greeted by one person , seated by another and had at least three servers taking care of me . and countless people stopped by to ask how things were , if i needed more water for my tea , or if i wanted more preserves for my toast . it was unbelievable ! while they have been open for months they had the staff of a place that has been open much longer . the ambiance is contemporary but is warmed up by the blue booths , checkered table cloths , and some mismatched dining tables in the center that can be expanded for larger groups . there are also antique food cases lining the walls filled with tins of chocolate , and other food cues . i also liked that they have those roll up doors on the one side that bring the outdoors in and seats outside on those perfect days . if i lived in scottsdale this would be my go to brunch place . what i don t get is why people are waiting in line at a place around the corner that left me a little cold . c mon people . if you haven t checked bacon out you should . after all what s not to like about , bacon ?

1,"i came here on a strong recommendation from a friend . after reading the reviews , i was anxious to try it out . i went on a saturday night , half expecting it to be really busy . we were seated in about five minutes or less . not busy on a saturday night . . . made me kind of worried . the menu is sparse , it made ordering really easy . service was fairly slow considering the small amount of people in the restaurant . refills were slow , service was kind of inattentive but not rude . our pizza came out in about mins . we ordered a white with garlic with pepperoni and sausage . the pizza looked and smelled delicious , but that s where it all went bad . first off , the pizza crust was really soggy because of all the grease under the pizza . i have never ate such a greasy pizza in my life . i had to drain every single slice , it literally created a puddle on my plate . there was a significant lack of sauce on my pizza , some parts of my crust were bare , not even a hint of red on them . the pepperoni and the sausage tasted great and there was enough toppings on the pizza to justify the price tag . the non soggy areas of crust were great , and the cheese was amazing . we ended up taking half the pizza home , the slices were filling . the pizza was better the next day , after the box absorbed most of the grease , after throwing away the pizza box , the bottom of the box was saturated in grease . i m not sure if grease makes a quality pizza , but in this case it just made a soggy crust . update under intense pressure i came back here and tried a white with chicken , they seriously redeemed themselves . i spoke to the manager and he insisted my last time was a fluke and should have been corrected . i would come back on occasion .

0,"wow . i m not even going to wait until i m done before leaving a review . i just placed my order , minutes after sitting down . sit at a table for an order drinks . so far so good . things were going alright when we had a table of , but when a few more people showed up to attempt to give floridino s some money in return for a quick lunch , all hell broke loose . there was a room next to us with a bunch of empty tables . you can t sit in there . we don t have a server in there . screw it , we picked up our drinks and moved in . if they can serve us at that table , they can serve us one table over in this other room . we asked to see the manager . we can get you drinks in here , but not food . we have to wait for a table to open up out there . then we can serve you . someone who looks like a manager peeks into the room and leaves . we still haven t spoken to a manager . . . we don t want to overwhelm the kitchen . hmm . . if you didn t want to overwhelm the kitchen , maybe you should have taken my order minutes ago . . . they re taking our food orders in the forbidden room . i guess they re not as allergic to accepting our money as they led us to believe . just received my food in the forbidden room . pretty much exactly an hour after i got here . you suck , floridino s .

0,"again , it s a bit unfair of me to rate this restaurant because i m from san jose cupertino but i m gonna do it anyway . so , being from san jose cupertino , i ve had me some good chinese food and even better dim sum . so when the boyfriend brought me here , i was expecting something decent , but not anything too authentic . this place was fairly decent and authentic ! it has the asian ladies and their dim sum carts . it has the og dim sum dishes . it even has the authentic less than mediocre asian service . the only disappointment is that this place is a bit dirty and ragged y looking . and the vegetable dishes are minimal . in fact , i had to order a veg dish off the menu because they didn t have any dim sum veg dishes and it cost ! bleh .

1,"while i am not usually a fan of corporate restaurants and brewpubs , bj s in chandler is an exception to the rule . the beer is fresh as it is brewed on site and they usually have a couple of offerings that set them apart from the main street amber ale brewpub crowd . the best deal is the all you can eat soup and salad at lunch for around . . food is above average pub food and the pizzas are a ok . they also make root beer for the kids .

1,"i m a loyal patron of steve s krazy subs , so i don t want to get involved in a family rivalry . however , sandwiches are my business and they deserve a fair critique regardless . at first approach , neds is much more of a professional looking sub shop . nice large dining area , clean , fancy tables more on those in a minute i was glad to see that neds had the same lunch special . . . in poorboy , chips and drink . more at neds , but you get bigger chips . tasted exactly the same , so tough to compare . my only complaint is the booths . probably great if you are , but for common folk , pretty uncomfy .

1,"i have to say i was pleasantly surprised by this place . when i first saw the address , i was very skeptical . it is in sunnyslope . i literally had to tell myself that there are still some gems on central and that this place was probably one of them . i m so glad i had that talk with myself . this place is nestled into a great little area of shops and cute patio homes , small businesses and a school . they have a great atmosphere , the inside has roll up , garage doors and there is a huge patio . my friends and i settled into one of the sofa areas and made ourselves comfortable . they have a decent happy hour , all wines are off and beer is . off . we ended up having some wine and a selection of brushetta , all was pretty yummy . the brushetta wasn t the best i have ever had , but there was a nice selection and it was pretty tasty . we had the brie and apples delicious , how could you go wrong , mozzarella and tomatoe also really yummy , brie and bacon which i didn t try and the tapenade a little salty , but what can you expect from chopped up olives ? . once happy hour ended , our very knowledgeable and helpful server told us that for we could get a bottle of wine and another order of brushetta , so we did . hey , why not , it s monday ! ? ! ultimately , i was only supposed to stay for an hour i was sick and jet lagged and just needed to go home and i ended up staying for almost four hours . as it got darker , the place took on a very sexy , relaxed vibe . i definitely like the place and i will be back . good atmosphere , good food , reasonable prices and friendly service .

1,"i can t speak for the vet portion , dog training or any other service , except the grooming dept . i take my dog in there during the winter to get groomed , shampooed and nails clipped , because sometimes its too cold out to dry him off . the girls in the grooming dept . are very nice and accomodating . they treat my dog well , and always have nice compliments about him . t they also do an excellent job and his nails are always done right . i ve taken him elsewhere once and they trimmed his nails down so much , that it hurt him to jump . i thought he had an arthritic condition , when i realized that he had his nails done , and sure enough , he bounced back a week later . these girls know what they re doing , and a couple of them have been there for a few years , as i recognize at least one or of them every time i go in . even to shop . thanks ladies !

0,"i enjoy falafels and my boyfriend really likes gyros . so , when we received a coupon for daphne s greek caf we were jazzed to go check it out . what i noticed right away is it has kind of a fast food sort of feel to it and i thought , ok , its catering to people on their lunch breaks . however , the food itself is like greek fast food for people who have never had anywhere near really greek food before and so they wouldn t know any better . the plates are astatically pleasing with everything arranged nice and neat . this amounted to zilch to me . when i got to eat , i want plenty of food and i want quality as appropriately expected from the type of establishment i am eating at . at daphne s you get a few little thin slices of what may or may not be real gyro meat . the falafel meat is little over fried disks . that s right disks . not balls of falafel meat where the outside is slightly crunchy and the inside is meaty and moist . the pita bread is not . it s just some flat bread cut into little triangles . the tzatziki sauce is . . . what the heck is this stuff in this little inch paper cup ? the vegetables were fresh . there is more to complain about with this place , but you get the picture . i m thinking that anyone who likes it here just doesn t know what real greek food is like .

1,"i have been to ra a handful of times for happy hour , and was always annoyed by the loud music and crowd . however , this time i went here for happy hour as a first stop for a bachelorette party and i had a great time . the upbeat social atmosphere was great for getting the night started . the group ordered a ton of appetizers and rolls , and even a drink each , and we walked out at about a piece . the elderberry mixed drink was especially good . normally , i do not pick this place for sushi happy hour because i don t like their quality of sushi and like quieter placed to relax with a friend or two . but if your going for a fun group atmosphere , this place is perfect . but only during happy hour , otherwise it is definitely not worth the price .

0,"when you walk into sky harbor , you are bombarded with declarations that it s the country s friendliest airport . huh . what does this mean ? user friendly ? friendly in a you ll always feel at home here way ? didn t really know , but it seems extremely important to their pr group , since when you sign on for the wi fi , you can t change pages until you rate how friendly the airport is from a drop down menu . it might be doing a disservice by proclaiming it as the superlative of congeniality . expectations run high at least by me . i found the free wi fi extremely friendly . yeah ! ! star for that . i found the den like check in area at least in terminal , not so friendly as it left me feeling a little depressed . the tsa officer who confiscated my oz apparenly it s . oz in phx neutrogena sun screen not so friendly . . . but not malicious , and i guess i wouldnt be so friendly if i were charged with monitoring tenths of ounces hour after hour . the spoke security system i found to be not so friendly to both users and retail . i never like seeing a plethora of places to purchase items before security , leaving you with only a few outlets for you to browse in your little concourse . i hate wondering , what do gates get to purchase ? is my concourse more vacant than the others ? just put security before all the retail and let us wander a bit . overall , not a bad airport . at all . the friendliest ? i don t know , but the free wi fi certainly made me leave with a smile on my face !

0,"i guess it s not really the most accessible place , but frank albert s is located in the arizona biltmore resort spa and serves as one of their restaurants to their guests . since the other breakfast place they had was only a cafe that served baked goods , i decided to come here to have a proper breakfast . when i asked what they recommended they immediately said the biltmore benedict . i was easily sold so i ordered one , and a coffee . cool thing about the coffee is they just bring you a carafe to serve yourself coffee as you please . not sure if this was because the waitress was lazy , but i thought it was nice . the eggs benedict themselves were not the best . on one hand the ham that they used was overcooked ie . jerky . on the other hand the english muffin was over toasted and too crispy , which kinda ruined the overall consistency . it is a nice patio that they have to sit on , so i will give them that . they apparently have a bird problem where birds kinda come and scavenge for food . i didn t really mind it .

1,"i went to blanco tacos tequila in scottsdale with my family for my birthday dinner . this is another one of sam fox s restaurants , and it serves up modern mexican fare . our party of five all got a ton of food that definitely required to go boxes throughout the meal . the atmosphere at blanco totally didn t surprise me , considering it s a fox eatery . there was the open kitchen , huge hanging lights , centrally located bar and airy feel . it was chic and dimly lit with candlelight , but there were televisions throughout broadcasting football games . it was a great mix of casual and fancy , making it the type of place where it s perfectly acceptable to go and just down a couple margaritas , or have a fun dinner date . i started with the blood orange margarita , which you should get with salt even though it s a little sweet . it was a strong drink , and the sweetness wasn t overpowering . for my meal , i started with the housemade guacamole to go with our tasty chips and spicy salsa , then had cheese enchiladas and finished with a tres leche cake . the guacamole was so amazing , other people at the table were also inspired to order it for their starter . i really liked the cheese enchiladas , but , as my mom pointed out , they re more modern in that they re not smothered and dripping with cheese . instead , they re covered in an interesting creamy ancho sauce . i guess i prefer traditional cheese enchiladas , but there was still a ton of cheese inside the tortillas that made me happy . the cake was really interesting . someone compared it to a bread pudding , since it was really crumbly and wet because it was drenched in a milky sauce . i liked it , but it was too rich to finish . altogether , i thought the meal was an excellent deal . i would definitely go back for the lively ambiance and tasty take on mexican food .

1,"say hello to the ghost lounge , folks . this is a brand new bar located right next to seamus , within the san carlos through an agreement with the hotel s ownership . for years , i ve thought the hotel san carlos was an under appreciated through its own fault downtown venue . with the ghost , the owner has finally executed a plan to revive its rightful place on the downtown phoenix scene . this is apparent from the first step inside the lobby , which appears as it did in when the hotel first opened . if celebrities in the s had to spend the night in phoenix , back then a small , un airconditioned cowboy town with around , , they would have stayed here . or else the near by westward ho . you get a taste of those times with the massive photographic blow ups the ghost has put up on its walls of various scenes from early th century downtown phoenix . so large that you can zero in on individual pedestrians on the streets , and marvel at their bowties , cowboy hats , handkerchiefs and facial expressions . back then , the san carlos was probably one of the only places in town that was air cooled . that may have meant it had swamp coolers . i haven t googled the history of air conditioning technology for this review . i d describe the bar s style as grandiose , and classic old school phoenix with an obligatory hint of chicago obligatory given the decades old economic relationship betweeen the two cities that endures to this day . it has been beautifully done . i will be back often .

1,"yum , jersey mike s ! i freakin love their wheat bread with the little specks of . . . i don t know what it is but it s very good . the mini sandwich looks tiny when you first see only the bread but after it s decked out and rolled up , it becomes a plentiful sized sandwich . i ve tried different sandwiches here . . . turkey , club both kinds , italian and cheesesteak and love them all . there s something about that oil and vinegar they top it off with in the end that seals the deal . other places do that too , but idk here it just tastes better . sometimes i ask for the chipotle mayo instead of the regular and it s quite yummy with a little added spice . also , i like that they carry pepsi products . i like it better than coke . and they have cherry pepsi , too "

1,"holy shit i love this place . i have been a regular here for years . eating at oregano s after a long work school week is really something to look forward to . the food is great . its reasonably priced , the portions are huge , and the drinks are tall . don t expect anything crazy culinary creations here , its just not part of the restaurant s culture . the food is simple and everything is tasty . i usually go with the sausage sandwich , or one of the pasta dishes with whole grain pasta , and one of their giant meat balls . its always filling , always good . sure the wait is long , but they always have free pizza , drinks , and deserts while you are waiting . service is always great . friendly , prompt , and they don t bother you when you don t need them . all of the servers are always willing to play along with my friends and our inappropriate conversations , challenges , etc .

1,"after a night of debauchery with friends , my friend and i found ourselves craving a comforting bowl of pho . i ve been a regular at cyclo s for quite sometime but decided to branch out and try something new . i was pleasantly surprised with pho ao sen ! i am always happy when i enter an asian restaurant and see asians patrons . . . probably sounds a little weird but to me it speaks volumes . the tranquil aesthetics of this quaint cafe made us feel welcomed and relaxed . the decor had a modern asian feel minimalistic organic zen with soft ambient music playing perfect for a sunday afternoon . we ordered the pho dac biet bo vien house pho nomenal house special combination of sliced eye round steak , well done brisket , well done flank , soft tendon , tripe , and beef meatball and the pho tai sliced eye round steak and goi cuon spring rolls . as with most vietnamese restaurants the portion size of pho is quite large and we could have shared . both were delicious , filling , and had a nice aroma but nothing too overpowering . i ve experienced a few places that use a little too much anise , so much that you can t get an overall sense of all the delightful herbs and spices used in this delicious creation . the spring rolls had a very fresh crisp flavor and were the perfect accompaniment to the pho . i give pho ao sen stars ! best pho i ve had in the valley , beautiful atmosphere and friendly staff makes me one happy girl !

1,"this place looks a lot worse than it is . the poorly shot photos of their food on their windows and walls do not do them any favors . i wound up eating here by chance when i was bringing back a group of teens to the jcc a few doors down we had a few minutes for lunch before bringing the rest of the kids back to tucson . most of the kids wound up in the mexican place next door , and seeing as we were pressed for time , i decided that id get some thai food since i love thai . i asked the lady in there if i could get something very quickly to go , she said no problem . i asked if i should get the pad thai or the yellow curry , she said get the yellow curry . so i did . she asked me how hot and knowing that i had a cold and wanted something kinda spicy , but also momentarily forgetting that i was in a thai restaurant i told her make it pretty hot . in retrospect , i might have used a bit more caution with that statement . i also ordered some crab puffs which i know is not authentic , but i was in the mood . the crab puffs turned out to be excellent . just different enough from your standard chinese food arrangement and yet still delicious with their different style dipping sauce . the yellow curry was amazing , albeit a little bit spicier than i would have liked on a normal day . . . well , actually , it was a freakin inferno . . . but it felt good to eat it with my cold and all . just be advised would definitely go back next time im in the area . my only complaints were that it took a little bit longer than i would have liked considering my situation , but had i been sitting down it would not have been a problem , and secondly the price was a little high i felt . it was after so a late lunch , i guess and wound up having to pay the dinner prices . the two orders , without a drink came to about . not terrible , but a little more than i would have liked to pay .

1,"we ate here while waiting for our tire to be fixed across the street . this place used to be the vine for many years , until it closed and the building became two different restaurants . the service was very friendly , and the menu had many different items in case you don t like sushi . we tried different bento boxes of ribeye teriyaki the online menu lists it as new york strip and chicken teriyaki . bento boxes come with so much food ! you start with a pretty good miso soup , and then the box comes with salad with a yummy soy vinagrette , two pork potstickers , rice , and fruit in this case , orange and apple slices . the steak was tastefully seasoned and melted in my mouth . the chicken was tasty as well , but i liked the beef better . then we opted for a few pieces of sushi , since this is a sushi bar . we had the nigiri salmon and cooked shrimp , a california roll , and a house specialty called the tukee roll . it is basically the california roll that is rolled in crunch tempura bits , and drizzled with unagi sauce and miso orange sauce . this was one of the best rolls ever ! a great twist on the plain california roll . our iced teas were a bit pricey at . for . too bad we were too full for dessert . check out their website for an unusually tasty menu . www . tankedfishaz . com .

0,"friendly staff and clean office . from what i have seen , somewhat frequent turnover with the dr . s i ve had . right now i have dr . susman , she s concise , to the point , compassionate , easy to understand . oral surgeon dr . lillien does his job well , i got my wisdom teeth out without complications or infections later . healed up pretty well . scheduled out pretty far so difficult to get an appointment in if you have specific avail abilities . certain staff could use more training on procedure and techniques to expedite the process and minimize x ray radiation time . julie is doing a breast cancer walk , so donate personal check and get teeth whitening kit for dollars . about staff kendall is very friendly and professional . noreen seems like she could use more training quite a few x ray retakes with bite tabs , but she was friendly overall . the process took a bit longer than i anticipated . suggestions train the staff thoroughly , with technique and procedure so it can speed up customer service . especially with bite tab as well as the other kind the red circular one . customers like to minimize their radiation exposure time clean office and helpful reception staff . dr . susman was to the point and very clear about wahts going on and what to do next . downfall scheduling can be somewhat difficult if ppl have specific avail abilities but in general , reception staff is very helpful"

1,"we arrived at the store several months ago to create a wedding registry , which was an okay experience . a registry expert sat us down and went over the basics , and then wanted to walk us through everything we may need on our list . we weren t interested because we re already home owners and just needed some entertaining extras and a few other items . luckily , after awhile she got the hint and left us alone . anywho . gifts began to arrive and were shipped directly to us , big plus . then came the true test . . . . . returns . easy as pie ! no problems ! i even wanted to exchange some items for a kitchen aide mixer which every domestic woman needs ! , and forgot my off coupon . oops . luckily , the cashier found one and let me use it which saved me bucks . everyone i encountered was helpful , the only downside is that it s a little unorganized and seems crowded with merchandise . anytime i am in need of a kitchen items , i ll grab my off coupon and return !

0," stars because i really did like the eye doctor i saw , she was awsome . thought i was off to a good start getting new glasses . i picked out my frames while i waited to be taken care of . oh . . . wait . . . the eye glass gods had something else in store for me . the person helping me couldn t get an authorization code from my insurance company because it was afterhours . he actually told me i had to pay full price or come back tomorrow . now keep in mind that i have had this insurance forever , never had any problems before after hours , weekends , etc . so i used my cell and called the insurance company . i get someone on the phone who is trying to help us . i put eyemaster guy on the phone and he actually got into a fight with the woman on the phone , handed it back to me and said here you talk to her , i m done . so the lady got me the authorization code and a explaination that this doesn t happen because most eye glass providers can take care of everything in spite of the insurance company being closed and she also asked me if i was sure i shouldn t switch eyemaster locations due to this guys behavior . but i thought i was done . i have my glasses picked out and i needed them to drive . so while she was talking to me the guy at eyemasters was throwing out insults loud enough that the lady could hear . so i lost hour of my time and think the worst is over well . . . those darn eye glass gods . . . i can t get them in an hour because it was too late in the day the guy tells me . he has the right lens and it was only pm , come back tomorrow . so i called today and was told hour and they will be ready . i drive over there on my lunch hour and guess what . they aren t even close to being ready . so i walk around the mall , come back and guess what , only pair is ready . that would normally be ok but the attitude of the two guys working is arrogant and not very customer friendly . i laugh it off and leave . so what are the odds i ll get my glasses after work today ? ? ? one can only wonder . awful service , unprofessional and unpleasant to experience .

1,"love oregano s ! they have delicious pizza , pasta , salads , wings , everything . the portions are huge and the prices are right and i can honestly say i ve never not left oregano s full and satisfied ! plus the atmosphere is fun as well . if you ve saved room after your meal , try the pizookie , it s amazing . giving stars because there is always a huge wait and they don t take reservations or seat you until everyone is there , and also because the deep dish pizza was far too cheesy and saucy when i tried it more than a deep dish should be but everything else is superb .

0,"i have never been here before so i didn t know what to expect . every time i heard the name duck decanter i would picture a nice sit down joint with waiters and pictures of hunting stuff on hunter green walls . this is certainly not the case i realized upon entering . it is just a sandwich place that also sells a bunch of random bric a brac . it is all basically picnic stuff i think . i dunno . . . it was real difficult to get a feel for the place . it was all pretty random to me . but anyway , about the food . . . . i ordered the duckling sandwich was is one of their signature sandwiches . it seemed like a good selection because the name of the sandwich and the sandwich itself had duck in it and so does the name of the restaurant . however , the sandwich was just ok . nothing special . not worth bucks . just a few slices of meat in between pieces of bread . all the sandwiches on the menu did however look interesting . they are definitely not your typical sandwich place type sandwiches . well some of them are but they all have that special duck decanter twist . the have some deli type sandwich selections as well but i would prefer to just go to a deli for those . my wife ordered the chicken salad and it was very very good . i would order it if i ever visit the place again . she ordered the sonoran with spicy oil vinegar . it was very tasty and no mayo or any of the bad stuff . the service was very friendly but i took a long while to get our sandwiches . there must have been a large order ahead of us or something because there weren t many people in the place . i couldn t imagine going here on a weekday during the lunch rush because the line would likely be out the door and would take forever to get your food . luckily for me i went on a hot sunday afternoon .

0,"we ordered from here the first day in our new home , also the first nfl sunday this season . i was expecting about an hour wait . they quoted me minutes for delivery , and when the doorbell rang after i thought it was solicitors or perhaps neighbors coming to welcome us into the neighborhood . i was pleasantly surprised that it was our food . we ordered a mushroom pizza meh , and wings and chicken tenders both very tasty . we re used to more thin crust pizzas , ny style i guess ? so this was a bit doughy , but the garlic herb crust was yummy nonetheless . not sure if we ll order from here again , unless we don t find our ny style place , but it was still good .

0,"in a word blah . it s a chain so i didn t expect much , and in this case my expectations were correct . i ordered the shrimp tacos were alright , but nothing to write home about . my take is that the food is mediocre and overpriced . plus the service was sub par we waited over minutes to get our drinks refilled and when we asked for separate checks the server grumbled about it . believe me , there is better , cheaper , and more authentic mexican food in arizona . "
1,"this place does not disappoint . i ve been here quite a few times with coworkers and it s always a good choice . cute place i especially like sitting on their cozy , covered patio . i hate mushrooms but somehow love their fungi pizza . i think it s the truffle oil that makes it amazing . i ve had a few of their other pizzas too , which are quite good as well . all of their salads are delish you can t go wrong with any of them . if there s just one other person with you , you can t go wrong sharing a pizza and a salad . this place is way better than pizzeria bianco . will continue to come back here !

1,"got the chance to go out with the wife and without the child , so we decided to go here after reading about beckett s table in the paper . a lot more casual than i was expecting , but not necessarily in a bad way i just assumed that being voted into the top restaurants in the city , the place would have a touch more snooty factor . kinda like an upscale , family restaurant if that makes sense . i started with the creamy grits and schreiner s sausage trio . i have to say it was my first time for grits . solid dish , i may prefer polenta to grits , but this dish was done really well . wife went with the brussel sprouts . very tasty , but strange to see as an appy thought it might be more of a side . seeing as they re not on the menu anymore , it doesn t matter . mains i had the short ribs and my broad had the cast iron chicken . i was blown away with the short ribs they were indeed fork tender , as i didn t lift my knife once for this plate . great flavourful mash with the red wine reduction . truly a great dish . wife s chicken was great as well . smoky , tender chicken with the incredible stuffing . bacon cheddar biscuits were ordered , but we had to take them home as we were both stuffed . a little dry , but good the next day , however . service was rushed in the beginning , as our waiter asked how are meals were , but was gone before i could answer . he was in the weeds though as it was hella busy for a while . he made up for it later in the meal . dessert wife had nutella pudding and it was adequate . the coffee creme brule on the other hand was outstanding . thick and rich , and packed of caffeine . good finish . oh , and good cocktail menu too . will return .

1,"i m so glad that there is at least one asian grocery store in the valley . unfortunately they seem to have a hard time keeping some of my favorite items in stock , i wonder if this is a result of some of the import restrictions delays that have been a result of the recent quality issues with food and toys imported from china . i m half chinese and spent much of my youth being dragged around chinatown near l . a . by my grandmother and or aunts . so the ranch market brings back memories . . . some fond . . . some not quite so . but , at any rate , the prices are great and the selection is good and authentic when it s in stock . the cashiers could use a little dosing from the friendly fairy , however . then again , i don t remember many friendly cashiers or clerks at any of the stores i frequented as a kid . . . so i guess it just makes the experience all the more genuine for me . i would recommend going on a weekday , or , if you must go on the weekend , just avoid going around lunchtime . there s a dim sum restaurant in the same shopping center and the parking lot gets pretty jam packed with cars and pedestrians .

1,"having just returned from a whirlwind overseas business trip , condor had to unwind . no place better than the spa at camelback inn . it has been years since condor visited and , as i expected , they did not recall that on my last visit i mistakenly thought the terrycloth robe and slippers were a gift . the letters demanding their return stopped after months . arriving in the lobby i was greeted by the soothing sound of asian zen music and the tranquil flow of fountain water . after a quick flashback to the three days in a jungle hut cell due to a jade sale gone bad , i headed to the luxurious locker , donned the fluffy terrycloth robe and settled poolside . my first disappointment of not having a drink in hand almost immediately was soothed when staff opened the bar hours early . talk about customer service at in the morning . having the secluded pool to myself , literally , i settled in to a literary vacation of the mind . it had been a long time since i read us weekly . engrossed in the torrid life experiences of the hoi polli , i hardly noticed companion had arrived and asked why i had already consumed six umbrella laden cocktails . the heat , i responded . it s degrees , companion stated with the accuracy of a former weekend weather girl in san diego . well , more cocktails ensued , including companion s mango margarita , whose orange color i compared to the stunning , skin tight dress worn by an unknown actress named roxie at a red carpet event in the pages of us weekly . the color of the mango margarita complimented the snow white of my robe after it was hurled in my direction . another drink soothed companion s ire and it was time for the highlight of the day our individual swedish massages ! escorted by my massage therapist , the spitting image of peta wilson google it . i was soon transported into a realm of relaxation and bliss . the bad news came when i was awaken from my trance by a knock on the door . it seems my snoring had disturbed the guests next door and my session was cut short . no matter , more poolside time with companion awaited and more frothy cocktails . unfortunately , upon return to my chaise lounge , i was greeted with a note . apparently companion and her male masseur hit it off and were enjoying cocktails at the valley ho hotel down the street . i was definitely not invited . well , upon reflection , the facility , service , therapist and massage were excellent . although romance did not blossom , i did add another terrycloth robe to my closet , albeit with a mango margarita stain .

1,"while i don t like to hype places up because really , how good can any one place be . . . how good can one burger joint be over another , or how good can pizza be over another pizza place when weighing the ones that are all generally good in the public opinion . now the word around town is that the grind is sofa_king great . i will say about the grind that when you re up for a burger , this place hits the spot . i ve been here once before august don t remember what burger i had but recall it was good and the other night i had the peppercorn burger and it was as good as it gets . i was starving and really hadn t eaten all day and that helped add to how much this hit the spot , but make no mistake , it was really good and i do enjoy this place for the atmosphere , service , and quality of food . my friends wife got one of those healthy wraps and she liked it a lot . the sweet potato fries we ordered the half sweet potato and half regular fries and they were good . as for some other areas to review the atmosphere is nice . it s casual and not too dark and not too light inside . that s how i like it . there s multiple flat panel tv s above the bar , so plenty of games on at any given time that s also how i like it . the service is fine although based on some other reviews people have been so so satisfied about the service . that s often going to be the case with most casual establishments so sometimes it s good , and sometimes not to our satisfaction . such is life ! anyway , back on track here , the wait staff and bar staff have been worth the tip both times . no complaints by me about this place , however i do see some and star ratings on here . where i will dock star and sort of agree with kristi d . she mentioned the large photo of sheriff joe arpaio on the wall while i sense that kristi doesn t care for sheriff joe , i m neutral about him , but i agree about all the oversized photos of notable names in town who have dined in the grind . i d much rather see real artwork or real photographs on the wall and not photos of sheriff joe , mark grace for those who don t know , he s a former baseball player , and the mayor of paradise valley , all holding their burgers . who the hell cares about any of them and their burgers . i think i d be more ok with having these photos above me , but they are huge enlargements and a bit overkill . and they are for sale and the proceeds go to some cause . look , i m all for causes and shit , but i wouldn t spend my money on a inch enlargement of these local notables holding a burger . the whole concept is pretty stupid . but hey , i m generally uptight and been doing photography years and probly am just hating on the fact that my photos are hanging on the wall . side note for those who might have previously had liked the grind on facebook but no longer have their page as a like , it s because they apparently had their group page hacked , so they had to start over . i found this out when i liked it the other day noticed there were only about like s , and certainly i knew this place was way more popular than that . when i commented that , they commented back about it being hacked and starting the page over . http www . facebook . com thegrindarcadia"

1,"family business bagel shops are my favorite . i found this place through groupon and decided to check it out . the name itself intrigued me as lox means salmon fillet that is cured . i didn t go with salmon , but i got a honey wheat bagel with veggie lite cream cheese . the cream cheese was freshly made with carrots , garlic , and celery . it had a light taste to go with a healthy and hearty sized bagel . my friends got croissants with cheese which tasted delicious as well . the prices are very reasonable here and you can order bagels by the dozen .

1,"i ve traveled to phoenix several times for business trips and stayed at the ritz . true foods was my go to spot in phoenix because it was right across the street from the hotel . i love this restaurant for the casual vibe and healthy food . my favorite dishes are the edamame dumplings and the miso glazed black cod . it was often hard to get out of work for lunch , so coming to true foods at the end of the day was always a treat . i only wish they had one in san francisco !

0,"zero stars ! i traveled from stl to sfo a few weeks ago with a layover in phx . i have a couple complaints one , i was checking pieces of luggage in stl . one ended up being lbs . over weight it was a cooler with food i bring home each year from my dad . i was charged an additional on top of the initially for the cooler to ship including the for my first bag so total ! this is an outrageous additional charge ! i thought overweight bags were charged an additional like other airlines i ve had to pay at but to ship one bag is just insane and a set price for overweight bags is not listed on your website ! on top of that i paid for a pet ticket so my baggage fees were total . . . more than my round trip ticket to fly . i couldn t believe that ! on another note , the woman agent helping me at stl was the most rude customer service agent i ve ever dealt with anywhere ! she was rude to me about the overweight baggage and then claimed my dog was too tall to fit in her carrier so she claimed she wouldn t allow her to fly . she raised he voice at me and called me a very inhumane person for making a dog ride like that for a whole flight seriously making me cry . i fly all over the country to do shows with my dog and this has never been a problem , including on the first leg of my trip when i bought the round trip dog ticket in sfo . this woman name calling was totally inappropriate . . . people in line beside me were astonished . since i had my round trip dog ticket purchased already , and she was sick of fighting with me over it , she let me go but told me the gate person probably wouldn t let me on the flight and of course the gate person did . between the dog crate episode and the bags , i have never been treated so poorly and charged with such ridiculously high adage fees . i m very disappointed to not be able to fly us air anymore since i never had problems with them in the past . it was a horrible way to end a very nice holiday vacation . i have passed the word on to as many people and websites as possible not to fly this airline !

1,"to quote my boyfriend , we like this place because they re solid . every time we order here , the food is great and fresh . i always get their sweet and sour chicken and i am never disappointed . instead of chicken chunks coated in batter , this place uses a chicken breast with batter that i would describe to be a thin tempura like batter . there is no excess batter or fat chunks to deal with it . the service is fast and we see the same waiter every time we eat here . this is the my go to place for chinese food .

0,"having lived in mesa and delivered sub sandwiches to some of the tweekiest of tweakers , i don t feel any shame in admitting that whole area now resides in a dead zone for me . when i get that itch to go out and tear up the town , waste away a lazy afternoon , or enjoy a nice dinner , i think of places north , south and west of tempe . it s like my brain has one of those little electric dog collar things attached to it , and when i start to stray too far east , it gives me a subliminal zap so i erase mesa from the map in my mind . so naturally , stray cats is usually a place i visit when meeting up with others who have suggested it . thing is , i always end up having a pretty good time when i go there . the drinks are priced reasonably and generally on the strong side , the bartenders are friendly and quick to serve . the music is pretty good , but i ve never been here when a dj s spinning . i used to like the fact that there was an air conditioned smoking room off to the side with plush couches and big televisions . the crowd is always diverse , friendly and easy to engage in slurred conversation . it just doesn t have any special oomph for me . i d much rather frequent hollywood alley a couple miles south , where there s pool and live music . unfortunately it s also on the black list of mesa , so maybe i should find a way to reverse that programming . it s not just tweakers and mormans , it s not just tweakers and mormons , it s not just tweakers and mormons . . . .

0,"friday night after a long workweek seemed to be a good time to treat ourselves to a new cuisine , so my friend and fellow yelper john m . and i decided to check out this uzbek restaurant . the interior would be mostly generic in appearance were it not for the somewhat ornate middle eastern curtains , and a tv screen playing uzbek and russian music videos added to the ambiance . large pictures of the main dishes in the counter area show you what they offer even before you are seated and handed a menu . for starters , we ordered uzbek salad tomatoes , cucumbers and sweet white onions lightly drizzled with a dill vinaigrette and blinchik , which are crepes with a flavorful meat and onion stuffing beware , the blinchik are rather filling by themselves . we also ordered palov and lamb kebabs . the palov was a dish of tasty seasoned rice with carrots and meat , and was quite a good choice . the lamb kebabs were juicy and flavorful , though the rice that came with it was on the dry side . a small basket of warm pita bread rounded up the meal . in all , it was a good meal , not great , but definitely satisfying . and i do hope to try the soup dishes next time .

1,"ok so i just read a few other reviews and i must comment on them first . the reason the portions are small people is because they are all appetizers . if you want heaping mounds of onion rings , go to fridays . the atmosphere is amazing . it isn t trying to hard to be cool you just don t know what cool is . it s okay . we all get old eventually . i actually asked a little about the lotus lamp shades . they said owner had them made in china and they are absolutely stunning . onto the food . delicious ! ! i ve been there twice now and my favorites are curry chicken wings wasabi chicken and the bacon wrapped mushrooms . if you re still hungry , ask for a side of rice and pour the remnants of your curry sauce all over it and lick the bowl clean . finger lickin good .

1,"ahh , the crave . having grown up vietnamese , i consider myself something of an expert on vietnamese cuisine . so i ve had great of course , my grandmother s and mother s food is star , and i ve had horrible . pho van putting accents on the vowels is difficult with an american keyboard , so i m not going to bother falls in the middle not my favorite , but not too bad . we started with appetizers . cha gio , which is a pork filled roll in a won ton wrapper , was okay . it tasted not so fresh , but had good filling , and the nuoc mam a fish sauce used to flavor was okay . my wife and i had goi cuon , which is a shrimp and pork , with vermicelli noodle rolled in a rice paper wrapper , was pretty good . this is dipped in a peanut sauce . i had the basic pho tai . this is a soup , typically pre prepared by putting cooked rice vermicelli noodles at the bottom of a bowl , and then very thinly sliced beef , and then hot pho broth poured over the soup to essentially reconstitute the noodles and cook the beef . the secret to pho is really the broth . typically , this needs to stand on its own to make a good judgement . it does it was flavorful , tasted fresh , and had a very rich flavor . i was pleased . for my own purposes , i do add hoisin sauce and srirachi hot sauce . having eaten here once before , i knew i wouldn t be disappointed . the only criticism i would have of this pho is that there s not enough of it . the standard bowl did not have much in the way of noodles or beef . for , i was hoping for more food . the rest of my family members had bun thit nuong cha gio . this is a traditional dish with rice vermicelli noodles , barbecued pork , and cha gio , over which you pour nuoc mam . there is a bed of fresh vegetables . this is what i typically think of when i think of asian salad it s bean sprouts , lettuce , mint , and cucumber . the barbecued pork tasted quite good as did the cha gio , once again . i found this food quite good as well . the restaurant was very clean , relatively quiet . there s a very pretty fish tank . the decor was very nice . the staff was attentive , and service was quick . i note though that it was pm on a friday , and the restaurant was unbusy . the nuoc mam smelled very funny to me though i m used to the smell of this food additive , and this one smelled quite odd to me . we are talking about something called fish sauce though , so i m sure there are variants . it tasted fine so no worries . staff needs to use cleaner towels when they wipe the tables as it does leave its own smell as well .

1,"dilly s has to be one of my favorite sandwich shops of all time . they have such a wide variety of choices that anyone who comes can pick something to suit their taste buds . i always go for the blazin buffalo because i eat wing sauce on nearly everything . boars head meats on all their sandwiches which is great but jacks the price up quit a bit . a sandwich , drink , and a side was about . i went with the pasta salad as a side , which was nothing special , your average run of the mill pasta salad . my sandwich on this particular visit was lacking a sufficient amount of buffalo sauce and i neglected to ask for extra before i left , assuming that they wouldn t be stingy with it . the bread is good , they toast it so it tends to get soggy if you take it to go . the bread bowls are good too , i ve had the clam chowder and chicken noodle and i recommend both . service here is usually quite slow . even when it s not busy in there , like today around , i had to wait minutes to get my sandwich and even saw some guy who was two people behind me get his order before me . when it s busy , you re going to be waiting even longer . they need to pick up the pace .

1,"note ignore the reviews above . it looks as if there is some deliberate attempt by the udupai owners to pose as members and bash this place . yes , this owner used to own udupai cafe and udupai cafe is another dosa house that competes with this eatery . if you read my other reviews , you know that i m critical and my attention to detail is there so i m not one of these people who likes every place he eats at . positives i m indian and i can assure you this place is good . i have never been to udupai cafe but based on its failing health inspections , i would be scared to eat there . woodlands is a nice clean eatery in a nice part of chandler . it s not a restaurant . it s basically a dosa shop . they specialize in dosa and offer several types . they also have excellent indian chinese dishes . the food is consistently good and i have eaten there on several occassions . this is a lunch light dinner place . don t think of this place like a restaurant . there are several types of dosa and that s what this place specializes in . the restaurant is also modern and not is some ghetto strip mall so don t worry about failing health codes here . . . at least not for a while . negatives their non south indian dishes are not so good . for non indians , they should be informed that this is a dosa house so order dosa and other south indian dishes . don t order your typical indian restaurant favorites like palak paneer it wasn t good here . the owner also says every dish is excellent which isn t true he is kind of a businessman so he doesn t really care about telling you which dishes stand out . stick to the dosa and the vegetable manchurian . their mango shake wasn t very good . their chiku shake is great .

1,"only stars ? a few notes the folks that rated this place low must have been isolated incidences and i feel weigh far to heavy on service rather than product . dining at a restaurant , rate the service a lil harder , but a coffee shop , hold your tongue . anyway , this place rocks . we aren t super close , but we pass up several coffee shops en route to lola because the quality is top drawer . the beans , fair trade , and the roast is perfect . the price of a bag of beans is amazing . doing right by the farmers and then respecting the product with such a solid roast . this is what is all about ! i have yet to find a better americano . a splash of cream and a splenda only augments the flavor of the espresso and the richness really shines . i ve been to most of the independent coffee shops throughout the area , and if i do find myself elsewhere , i can only compare them to lola , and lola wins out each time .

1,"blurb for iphone app great enchiladas , chips and salsa made fresh , but beans left something to be desired . give it a try nonetheless . i just wrote the last part because i will be on the yelp app , and notice that i often start my review with something that is not useful at all . . . which is that everyone sees when searching on their mobile phones . so i guess you could say i m optimizing for mobile . ok , now on the full review . took off a star for the beans . . . they just weren t great . the person with me had a taco salad , and said they didn t get a lot of meat in it . . . and the rice was good , but not great . however , this was balanced by the chips and salsa which i always eat so much of that i m not hungry by the time the food shows up which seemed to be made fresh , not too hot , but with plenty of flavor . the hot sauce hot is entirely objective here was very good , and i used that for my chips as much as the salsa . didn t ask if they had anything hotter , as the true chilehead will think it s pretty mild . . . i had a chicken enchelada with green sauce and a cheese with red . . and although i usually like the green better , the red here is great . one word of advice however don t step on the scale the next morning , because you are going to stuff yourself while you are here .

0,"i m used to ranch back in northern california , and this supermarket wasn t anything spectacular . this is a good place if you want seafood ! all of the traffic was around that area . the food from the take out section didn t look too good . the market also has the bakery , peking duck , the flattened duck , and roasted chicken . there is also hong kong express to go food where you can order noodles , dim sum , congee , boba drinks , rice dishes , etc . it s right next to the take out food . the most interesting part of the supermarket was the selling of chinese pancakes in front of the store . you can order mini pancakes with either a red bean , coconut , or custard filling . each pancake is made to order and is . each . i tried both the custard and red bean pancakes and it was pretty good ! cash only payment for the pancakes . you also have to wait awhile for the pancakes since there is a long line .

0,"if you have ever eaten at an exceptional german restaurant , you will be ruined for life . years ago , the haus would have gotten stars . but after being turned on to a little gem in gibson city , il called the bayrn stube my appreciation of fatty meat and spices stuffed in an intestine laid on a bed of sauerkraut and red cabbage has been forever changed . haus just doesn t quite measure up . the cup of soup before the entree tasted like it came out of a can and the bread looked like the sheets of hawaiian bread you buy at wally world . probably the biggest turn off was when they brought out the brown mustard still in a plastic squeeze container . my meal was the nuernberger kassler combo for one , and i had enough left over for breakfast the next day . their sausages seem to be of lesser quality than i would get at sunflower and the red cabbage had some pork gristle in it . not that i mind a little pork fat in my cabbage , but not chunks , and definitely not gristle . my friend ordered the huehner chicken schnitzel , which had a very good flavor , it was the best part of either of our meals . they do have a nice selection of good beers on tap , no aventinus though . if the food was anything other than german , it would get stars . it is nice to have somewhere to get a schnitzel when i m in the area , but i wouldn t drive out of my way to eat here .

0,"this is one of those reviews where a qualifier is required . it seems like everybody that gives this transit system a good rating is a phoenix native . that makes this , like so many other things , good for phoenix . the problem is that it s terrible compared to nearly every other metro system in north america and absolutely abysmal compared to more progressive parts of the world . this is quite possible the slowest train that i have ever ridden in my life . it seems to make stops every two blocks and it take far too long to get anywhere . factor in the terrible hours of operation and you re going to easily find yourself stranded at one end or the other after a night at the bar . please work on expanding the routes and hours , speeding up the trains and then maybe you ll be able to increase ridership . i m a huge fan of mass transit but this train falls far short of expectations .

1,"let s start by disclosing that i grew up in new orleans , went to school in lafayette home of the ragin cajuns , and really know good new orleans cajun food . i grew up eating great po boys , gumbo , red beans , and wouldn t consider eating any of these if not well prepared . that said , i can truly say that jennifer and the flavors of louisiana gang make cajun food as good as any you ll find in new orleans seriously . the po boys are spot on though the bread could be a little crustier and the chicken andouille gumbo is even better than mine and , i assure you , that s damn good . frankly , i ve never had better . the only thing that is not as good as it gets is the red beans and rice . they re good , but not quite the creamy washday monday staple that i grew up on . my cajun grandmother has jennifer beat on that one , but not by much . but , if you want a special treat and want to taste something that kills all , get a sausage po boy . hot sausage or smoked sausage po boys are a new orleans staple and my favorite po boys of all . but , jennifer blows them all away with her home made andouille . simply put , i ve never had better sausage ever . it s the reason her gumbo is soooo good and her po boy the best ever . i ve eaten at flavors many times , even though i live across town . every time i go , i eat like a pig and bring some home to eat later . i have no affiliation with the restaurant , but wanted to post this as a review from someone who really knows new orleans food and as a thank you to jennifer and her crew for giving me a source for the best flavors in the world not just louisiana . as a matter of fact , i even overlook the fact that jennifer is from baton rouge , instead of new orleans or lafayette and for not having any usl ul lafayette paraphernalia on the lsu saints wall . at least that is , so long as she keeps her promise to open another restaurant on the east side of town that is , a lot closer to where i live . if you want the only good cajun food in phoenix , treat yourself to flavors of louisiana . for me , it s just like a visit to any of my favorite po boy shops in the old neighborhoods . it really is that good .

0,"despite not being federal employees in any way , memorial day seems to be a time when restaurateurs think they deserve a day off , leaving me with few actual lunch options and relegating me to the worst of the worst eating . in an airport restaurant . turns out that taberna wasn t actually as bad as all that the bar is nice to spend a few hours waiting for your flight , and the titular blue burrito despite not being blue in any way , shape or form wasn t too bad by fast food standards , and quite plentiful for the i spent on it . and if you don t like it , you can cover it with cholula , close your eyes , and pretend you re eating somewhere better .

0,"when i walked through the swinging doors around noon on a sunday , i walked into hooterville . think silicone , fake tans , bleached hair and teeth and caked on makeup . and the men here overdose on testosterone full of bulk and attitude . think sideways baseball hats , torn jeans , flip flops and gold . even at noon on a sunday , they were on the hunt . joining me in alienation was my san franciscan friend . we represented the world of natural size and color . to bring ourselves comfort and escape in this fake world surrounding us , we discussed environmental concerns . i got the buffalo chicken sandwich . commensurate with the theme here , this was the biggest breast i d ever seen . the sauce was super hot and tasty . the baked beans had a southwestern flare with crushed pepper . my friend got the chili , which he said was slightly spicy hot but not temperature hot . i didn t attempt the bucking broncho , for many reasons , but one of them being that there was nothing on it to hold on to . too difficult for a delicate northerner like me .

0,"ahhh . . . zinc . it s been a while since i have left paris . being a resident and citizen there for so long , i would like to think i can spot a decent french fare . i have now been to zinc three times , every time i ordered something different , so far the food has not dissapointed as much as the prices have . wow . okay , okay , you have a spot in scottdale , it s a nice little posh area with plenty of traffic , designer furniture and nick nack and artsy stores that typically have things that would require your to take out a nd mortgage to afford those things that often just gather dust , one season at a time at home . you would think someone on that strip would be the one to say , let s have reasonable prices . zinc is not one of those . the restaurant has the name bistro in it . they have folks dining out on the sidewalk , dining with noise and the occasional smell of bmw exausts . . . that s beautiful and very parisian , also very bistro . here is a wake up call though . . . bistros offer fares with decent prices , a prix fixe menu and simply good simple food . the prices were incredibly high for what you do get . unfortunately the charm of having an outdoor patio and serving fries in fake newspaper doesn t cut it . the steak frites a hanger steak w fries and a brandy sauce is a french bistro classic , a staple if you will and that was the only thing that was fairly prices for what you get . but if you knew how much those cuts are to get from a supplier , you d be asking questions about the prices even then . on two of those occasions we had cheese plates , it was more of a mix and match , you could pick from a few chevres , softs and hard cheeses , they were incredibly small portions but the breads that came with the platter was very tasty , warm and fresh . it is typically served with a ramkin of olives . so overall , sounds like i am bashing this restaurant , i am not but i am dieing to find a reason to go back because there is something good about it , the atmosphere , the lighting , the seasonal menu . but little things keep me from enjoying zinc . such as the time we sat at the secluded back part of the restaurant , the small courtyard . very charming , though some of the waiters , and cooks smoked right outside of the courtyard s gates . the smell of cheap cigarettes and mumbled chatter caused us to ask for another table , when we did , we were all the sudden looked as picky customers . one more tip zinc , you may want to get the mall janitor to move his trash can from the view of your utmost beatiful courtyard , such promise , undelivered due to tacky flaws that could have been prevented by an attentive manager or even a caring waite staff . don t miss dining in the courtyard , or the sidewalk . skip specials that are simply trendy"
1,"great place with good service , a nice menu , and a fantastic wine list in terms of quality , quantity , and value . we enjoyed the abbaye de bellocq and taleggio caravaggio cheeses with the order of the french plate that included pate , cornichons , figs , dijon mustard , dried cranberries , and baguette . none at the table were very knowledgeable about cheeses , but we told our server zach our likes and dislikes and he steered us in the right direction . this was a very nice start to the meal and ample for four people . we paired it with an cakebread sauvignon blanc . there was a dinner entree of risotto cakes w peas , asparagus , and mushrooms that we all wanted to try so we put it in as an order for an appetizer . the portion was fairly small so it was perfect for an appetizer , but i would have been a little disappointed had someone ordered it for their main course . for our entrees two of us ordered the duck and the other two ordered the scallops . the duck was prepared perfectly with crisp skin and moist breast . this was served atop a red wine risotto with blackberry gastrique . the menu stated there would be seasonal vegetables , but i caught very few on my plate . the scallops were also cooked perfectly and were served with spinach tomato olive pasta . we ordered a bottle of delas saint esprit cotes du rhone . i felt bad about ordering one of the cheapest bottles on the menu only ! , but the cotes du rhone caught my eye and i wanted to try it . it ended up being a very nice wine , whatta steal . due to dietary restrictions of one guest , we had to request a change on one of the entrees and the server was very respectful of it and discussed it with the chef who obliged with no issues . kudos for going out of their way to take care of us . for dessert we had a chocolate cookie filled with molten chocolate served with ice cream , along with cr me brulee . both were not out of this world , but a nice finish nonetheless to a fabulous meal . all in all this was a great place that was very reasonably priced where you could go all out and not feel too bad when the bill came . i enjoyed the wine list and it was apparent that they did not markup their wines as much as other restaurants . the only reason this place does not get stars is portion size , lack of vegetables with the entree i much enjoy a meal of protein , vegetable , starch with somewhat equal ratios , and there was not one wow factor in which i will be telling my friends you must order this dish or a dish i have to come back for . i wouldn t have minded the small portion size at all had it perhaps been on a bigger plate with more use of color . i would definitely enjoy coming back and would love to try their happy hour . i also love how they are open on monday evenings since a lot of nice places aren t . sorry this is my first time writing a review so if you don t want to read the whole thing positive great wine list outstanding cheeses on the mark entrees knowledgeable and attentive staff negative portion sizes lack of vegetables"

1,"when shopping is an adventure and a destination , you must be heading to tan phat . this is a funky asian market that has been there for me whenever i need water chestnuts for wrapping in bacon , and they carry five different brands ! who knew so many companies were in the business of the water chestnut ? or kitchen supplies for asian themed dinners . one of the first things that hits you upon entering in the smell of seafood . after acclimating to that , you ll find a huge selection of canned goods , dried seafood and mushrooms , a decent selection of fresh produce and an ample amount of novelty edibles you know , those intriguingly package foodstuffs that you just can t find outside of asian markets . the employees are usually polite . you may have to walk through every aisle to find what you need , but that s part of the adventure .

1,"tried this place through groupon . don t have a palette or interest in wine types , so i can t talk about the wine quality . i had all their sweet wines and liked them . the cheese plate had four of them , i wouldn t say they were uniquely different from one another . there was sage derby , brie , mahon and something else . one of the crackers that came with the plate was very hearty and nice , the other was horrible like oily tortilla chips that weren t fully fried . the plate also came with cranberries , apricots , grapes , olives and salted nuts and seemed like a good value . overall though i had a good time , and thought the combination of wines and cheeses i had was good . the decor was typical az type , brown and beige . they had live music . we sat at the tasting bar but there were groups at tables too . outdoor seating was available too . saturday evening was full but not overcrowded . the person who attended on us was very nice christine i believe her name was . another guy who talked to us first thing when we sat down asked and classified us as groupon or non groupon , which felt weird but i guess that reflects how many groupon customers they had had . he also said you are not drinking to make me happy , you re drinking to make you happy when we asked him if he had recommendations which i thought was weird at best .

1,"this place is fantastic . great food , superior service , gorgeous decor . . . i had a breakfast casserole and a generous side of cheesy grits . my girlfriend had the blue plate special which was a frittata . the breakfast casserole is a medley of sausage , roasted vegetables , and potatoes with cheese , topped with a poached egg . there were no overwhelmingly strong or weak flavors , and i didn t see any extra oil in the dish . it came with a side of toast . i chose the marble rye and was disappointed only to see that the butter it came with was a hard stick . the grits were definetly made with milk and butter and had some cheddar cheese sprinkled across the top . the grits were more solid than watery which was a big plus for me , as i prefer my grits closer to the drier end of the spectrum . after breakfast i ordered a bloody mary at the bar inside and it was spicy and delish , a really good balance of tomato to booze . i liked it a lot . what i liked the most , though , was the really good service and friendly attention we got from our server , the hostess , the bartender , the bar manager , the valet drivers , and even being greeted by the concierge and check in when we weren t even staying at the hotel . i will definetly make it a point to come here again .

0,"if only i where rating this place based on their sushi i would give it stars . but , i m not rating it based on the food . it is purely based on the customer service in this establishment . be warned if you have a large party this is not the place to go . i ve been in the restaurant industry for over years and i have never heard of a restaurant not splitting checks for large parties . so for an over . bill they will take different forms of payment but won t split up the check by individuals or couples . how does this make any sense . to make matters worse they bring out the sushi and i quote family style . since when did sushi get served family style ? here is the problem . sushi is expensive , not everyone at the table ate it and when served family style someone else may get what you ordered and you won t have a clue it even made it to the table . we spent over minutes trying to figure out this bill , seriously ! when i asked the manager her generic and obviously well rehearsed response was this is our company policy , we do not split checks for large parties . this is absurd . so not only did we have a heck of a time figuring out the bill , i m pretty sure no one really knew who had what and if they had added random things to the bill . how could you know with that many people ordering ? ? ? ? i never received part of what i ordered yet it made it on that bill . so here we have to pay it regardless of what we may or may not have received ? i understand that adding gratuity to a party this size is also common practice which i don t normally have a problem with but how about some excellent customer service in return . if policy is no separate checks , at least tell everyone as they order or as a group that this will occur . they said someone was told when the reservation was made . the reservation was made for people ! it would ve taken seconds to again relay this important piece of information . worst experience ever !

1,"should be called house of deliciousness ! i could go on and on about this item , that item , blah blah blah but i dont really waznt to . this is good food , done creatively , and in my mind presented in a casual yet sophisticated manner without any pretensiousness . the chef here creates inspirational dishes that seem to meld asian and southwestern flavors seemlessly . ok so now i realize this are not all real words but after eating here and developing a drunken state of mind who really cares anyhow ? the lowdown is the food is good and priced fair for what you get . our service was great and on top of everything we truly had an amazing time on a rainy saturday evening . next time hopefully we can enjoy the killer outdoor bar and patio seating . i cant wait to go back and eat our way through the new menu . the custom cocktails were delightful and the wine list is pretty spot on .

1,"i usually hate chains , especially italian ones like olive garden and romanos . but i was pleasantly surprised my maggianos . we went because we got a gift card for christmas but we are probably going back . the bread and the dipping oil they start you out with is pretty good . i wish the dipping oil was just a little more seasoned though . my husband ordered the linguine and clams which he said was just ok . my stepson had the crab and shrimp cannelloni which he enjoyed . i really liked my eggplant parmesan . it is the best egg parm i have had at a chain . the sauce is fresh tasting which huge chunks of garlic . one nice surprise is that our server said that my dish qualified for a free take home dish of the same category . so i ordered the gnocchi and had a nice dinner the next day .

1,"after browsing at the bookman s next door , we were feeling hungry and were tempted by the notion of tasty burritos . we ended up getting non burrito meals , but were fully satisfied with our entrees . the green chile plate was filled with perfectly cooked pork with a spicy tomatillo sauce that went well with the pork . the horchata tasted freshly made and was very refreshing and light . overall , i think big burrito is a good option for those that want a filling meal without breaking your wallet .

1,"yes , it s pricey , so i got a membership . yes , the membership is pricey but if you go frequently and you ll want to with the hot summer months you ll get your money s worth and then some . the place is big enough that you can do different exhibits for each trip . great place to take the grandparents to watch the kids in their element , too !

0,"have been here several times prior , food is ok and service is mediocre at best . sitting at the bar to eat and drink does not fast , quality service . it equates to unattentive bartenders watching sports rather than clearing plates or pouring drinks . an empty pint should have another offered in its place , and napkins on plates are clear indicators that one is done ! fifteen minutes passed before plates were cleared ! ! ! service must improve ! ! !

1,"i was contacted by the manger at this location cause of my bad review , i am really for proactive owners . i really need to go back to this location to give them another try since the first time i went there it was really good . i was given a gift card to wipe out what i paid for the last meal as kinda of do over . i will be back anthony and i will let you know how my next visit is .

1,"this is one of my favorite places to eat when i get back to town . their beans are the best i ve had . their tacos are made of shredded beef and fried with the fillings inside . this makes the best product . all of you lucky enough to live in the state don t realize how lucky you are to have this treat ! i m usually not an enchilada fan , but you have to try one here . some of the reviews comment on decor . while it is true the place is a little shabby and the salsa comes in squeeze bottles , i would much rather have their cheap prices than fine china . and that salsa , i really would be tempted to steal one of those bottles , but then i d have to check it in my bag to go back home !

1,"okay , i admit it we are waaaaay late to this party . we tried once before but the hour plus wait was just two much for the four starving carnivores with me that day . this time our strategy was to go early on a saturday morning as close to am opening as possible . we arrived around it was the weekend after all and only waited about min for a table for two . i had the special of the day egg scramble with andouille sausage , fresh local baby spinach and fontina cheese yum ! the sausage had just the right enough of bam and the home fries with rosemary and onions rocked . my companion had the hog and chick awesome meaty bacon with that . great value for the price i packed up at least half my meal for the starving teenagers at home who could not be roused at dawn . if you haven t been , get up early , bring a newspaper and rest assured matt s big is well worth the wait .

1,"i ve practiced yoga for years at at one yoga and initially wasn t happy about their merger with lifepower . but now , after several months of going to lifepower , i think it s pretty nice . the facility is big and clean and very well kept . if you want to use the entire facility the weights and machines you have to sign up for a monthly contract . however , if you just want to take the yoga classes , you can buy them packages of ten classes . the ten classes can be used over any length of time . i like that because if i m out of town or busy , my class package doesn t expire . i do wish they offered more class packages , like in groups of or classes , the the way at one yoga used to do . because typically the more classes you buy , the bigger the discount . the great majority of the yoga instructors from at one yoga have come over to teach at lifepower . i ve taken yoga classes in several places throughout the us and i think these yoga teachers are among the best in the country .

1,"we had the luxury of eating here over the past weekend and what a treat . i had the oz . filet with the blue cheese on top and my wife had the oz . both excellent ! side dishes starch veggie were solid ! we ordered the house wine recommended and also cheaper by the glass than other featured items . also , i am thrilled to see some of the newer restaurants coming to the area . having lived in carefree for almost years . . . seeing it start to boom in addition to offering restaurants with flavor instead of simply western decor really is nice . waiter was extremely informative . i even joked that he could of probably been a voice over in some animated movie or tv commercial . anyhow , thanks for a great night out . we plan on coming back next time we visit . . . can t wait to try the seafood .

0,"i booked a night at this resort hotel because my daughter had a volleyball tournament in the area , and they had a special for off suites . i wasn t impressed for a number of reasons . first , even after the discount the rate was . which included an . normally . resort fee which included things that any other cheaper hotel motel would offer for free like local calls . second , for the price i would expect modern things , like maybe a flat screen t . v . ! come on , they ve been around for what , years now ? and a high dollar place like this can t afford one ? another annoyance was the fact that their high speed internet access costs . a day . i can get free high speed internet at any motel hotel for less that . a night . other annoyances include a t . v . remote that didn t work , and a shower head that was so loose that it almost came off when i tried to adjust it . i would never , ever pay . a night for this place , and regret even paying what i did .

1,"i know little about ethiopian food . i m an adventurous eater , and was taken here to try it . and i must say , now , that i am a fan ! the food was very cheap , and incredibly flavorful . so , if you re on a budget , and want to either impress a date with your culture , or are a foodie , this is a great place to try ! i am writing it only as stars only because i haven t tried any other ethiopian food . however , i pretty much don t want to risk tr . ying another place the ethiopian tea they serve is fantastic , along with your meal . the portions are generous , along with generous amount of of injera . we has more than enough food around us , and left stuffed . the dish that especially impressed me , was the curry chicken . so much so , that i continually kept enjoying the injera in the sauce . all the vegetarian food was delicious ! i , unfortunately , don t remember the names of everything , but the greens were some of the best i ve ever had , along with a lentil dish . also , i rated this good for kids , however , that s only because i have a toddler that eats anything ! if you don t have problems feeding your kid unique food , i suggest an attempt ! in short , if you re a big food fan , or want to be a little more adventurous on your food options , especially for a great , fair price , try blue nile ! !

0,went here about two months ago and am only now getting around to reviewing it . i think that should stand for something in terms of my experience there . the service was ridiculous . if one is going to charge the prices they charge for regular americanized asian food . . . at least make sure the menus you hand people are clean . or your plates for that matter . or silverware . seriously ! did everything have to be covered in grit or a mysterious sticky substance ? next up . . . the menu . not everyone eats meat . how about a little more choices for us who prefer tofu over dead animal ? i ordered the coconut curry vegetables . bland bland bland . i ve had more flavor out of an unseasoned packet of ramen . and would it kill them to actually put some tofu on the plate ? i guess i just don t understand the hype . the prices are ridiculous for the quality received . you re better off going to some little hole in the wall place where the food actually tastes like food and not reheated leftovers . 
0,experience with hostess was rude . service with a frown . our waiter had attitude too . it was a birthday dinner and we were in great spirits . . so this review is written with clarity . the margaritas were strong check ok there . the shrimp appetizer was different and very good and for four shrimp . we ordered two mahi mahi dinners each and they were rancid . yup . i said rancid . we asked if the shrimp fajitas dinner had the same jumbo and they said they would have to charge extra each entree was priced at we had to pay extra for the beans and rice that they had left on the table which was cold by the time the shrimp dinner which came with shrimp and onions . poor service with an attitude . mediocre food to say the least . . . all over priced . never going back .

1,"the boyfriend and i like to do little staycations every now and then so when we saw a deal advertised for the camelback inn we jumped on it . we stayed two nights in just a regular room , i guess . they had several different kinds of suites even rooms with a private pool ! but our room was a standard room with a nice patio facing camelback mountain . the room was spacious and clean , the bed was comfy and the patio was the perfect place to enjoy breakfast . camelback inn was much bigger than i expected . lots and lots of buildings spread out over the property . it s not the easiest place to find your way around but at least it s pretty to look at while you get lost . at the back of the property is a little ghost town set up . it looks like they do corporate events cowboy cookouts but nothing was going on while we were there . but we had fun wandering around the town and taking goofy pictures of each other . even though it was december it was warm enough to hang out by the pool . the pool is heated so that helped and there are two hot tubs as well for really chilly days . they have an abundance of lounge chairs and even offer float rafts and fun noodles for the pool . there were kids splashing around but the area is big enough you can hide away from the action if you prefer . we ate at two of the restaurants while we were there blt steak and rita s kitchen and both were fantastic . we loved our camelback inn staycation and would not hesitate to go back especially in the summer when the rates are low !

1,"it was a hot day with great bbq ! with the yelp discount , admission was reasonable compared to the original price , and there were a good number of bbq stands to try . samples consisted mainly of pulled pork with bbq sauce , although a few stands did sell items such as hot links , rib tip , and brisket samples . i would have liked to see more stands that sold plates of food rather than samples , for those with a bigger appetite . towards the back there were also some stands that had food and home items for sale e . g . , cutco knives , clothing , salsa , etc . . it would also have been nice to see more items for sale that were bbq related aprons , grills , tongs , etc . . all in all , i m glad i went !

1,"this place is fantastic . about the restaurant itself . it s right by downtown phoenix , and in fact right next to a light rail stop so keep this in mind , parking is metered and sometimes hard to come by easily , if you live by a light rail this may be the smarter option . the place is seriously tiny , only about groups of people can be seated at one time . a slight drawback is that there is limited outdoor seating , which , given the predictably large lines even on weekdays , is a problem . the phoenix sun will make a minute wait seem like an hour and a half wait . now about the service . i ve always had a good experience with the people who work here . the first time i came here , apparently one of the owners saw that i looked lost , because she came out and very kindly explained how people are seated , where i can go to get coffee in the meantime . she even suggested i leave my cell phone number and she ll call me when my seat is ready , in case i m shopping for example . the waitresses always serve us quickly and never leave us hanging , and they re always smiling , which for some reason makes the experience so much better . now for the best part . i swear , they put crack in their food , because although their breakfast options are simple , they are out of this world . the first time i came here i got the waffles . perhaps it s because they use real maple syrup , or all of the ingredients are organic and locally grown , but they make the best waffles i ve ever had . i don t even know how one makes a good waffle really , it seems pretty formulaic , but it s stellar . i ordered it with bacon , which was also wonderful the bacon used was the good stuff , not the excessively fatty bacon you buy at the supermarket . every bite is spectacular , and when you re done , you re full , but not the kind of full you ll often get at breakfast joints where you think you re going to explode or take a nap full , but refreshed . the second time i came i got the pancakes . not the best pancake i ve ever had , but still , superb and the real maple syrup just sends it through the roof . the third time i went i got the waffle again see above . before i came here , i was excited about leaving phoenix for new york due to the incredible array of dining options you get in that city . now i m worried there won t be anything as good !

0,"it saddens me to say that this isn t the worst mexican restaurant we ve eaten at , that s on oahu near waikiki beach , but it s close . damn it we had to drive by arriba s to get to this place . i had a chimichanga that was a little anemic , though what there was of the filling was ok , beans tasteless , rice looked the part but as spicy as your average uk meal involving boiled meat and root vegetables . erin s fajita salad was similarly lack luster with all the appearance of being tasty yet bland chicken . usually , unless there s an attempt at chefing as opposed to cooking i ll order a basic dish i don t shoot the chef though and trust me these guys are safe from agent sands , very safe for the first time out and if the beans rice suck . . no return . overall it feels like aliens , space ones , are running the place and they learned cooking from pictures . it s certainly a mistake we won t be repeating .

0,"not impressed . start with the service . not professional . it seemed as though the wait staff was clueless as to the table numbers . we were given the wrong table s order twice . second , the food was conceptually a mess . no clear theme or flavor profiles . the food was heavy , greasy and took forever to arrive . none of the dishes were memorable . third , the wine selection seemed to be lacking . and , the sommelier didn t know where the wine was from she was serving . not impressed .

1,"i have to admit , the reason i gave this place stars instead of is a i want it to stay in business which can be hard on mill these days ! and b it s one of the few places on mill where you can bring your child without feeling like you may get heckled . lol now , i definately enjoy a night out without the babes too , but this is a place i go for happy hour with my husband and daughter . the beer wine is good , the food is good i like the southwestern egg roll apps , the price is good , the service is good , and the atmosphere is nice thought i was going to say good , huh ? . we love to sit on the patio and people watch .

0,"the food is simple , pure and uncomplicated you taste and hopefully enjoy each ingredient . however , as with most minimally processed cooked foods , it does not travel well . so , eat in . luckily the decor is modern and compliments the menu well which makes eating in a pleasure . my only down note is on the service . if you are not careful when you enter the restaurant , you may enter through the door of invisibility and will become invisible to the employees . as a result , you may stand at the counter while they work around you but do not recognize your presence until the invisibility dust or whatever makes you invisible wears off . based upon my late lunch experience today , the dust takes iphone e mail responses or texts to be removed ish minutes . regrettably , i only had three unanswered e mails in my inbox and had to leave before i could be seen by the employees . on a positive note , when you leave regardless of the time you waited , the invisibility dust seems to be removed . i know this as no one honked or screamed at my car as it drove away without a driver .

0,have been in twice since my last review . its a like a completely new atmosphere ! ! and sorry to say this is not in a good way . service was terrible and i was emberassed that i actually brought some new people with me to try it out . just went for this saturdays last ufc fight ! they were like natzi s with the seating you have to have of your party with you to get a seat even though my boys were parking and in the parking lot they gave our table away so after getting the tenth degree abou there seating rules we were finally sat all had to sit speraticly through out the bar . we should ve just turned around right then but decided to stay . . . then on top of that we were sat next to some drunk beligerent people spilling and flirting with there server wich you could tell made her uncomfotable that table were continuosly getting over served beers . since there was not one mgr in sight the little time we were one of my boys stepped in and there was almost a fight right then and there . . putting that aside our service was horrible some dude was our server and we went without seeing him for like min and not so cold beers . at that point after one round of drinks we decided not to order food and the table next to us was gripeing about there food so that was another sign to get the f out of there so we paid once the server got back then bolted . i wasn t going to yelp anything but i just received my checking statement and the dude added to his dollar tip . i gave the guy on he was lucky to have even gotten that . i m going to find out the guys name and go to upper mgmt because this is not the first time i ve heard of this happening there . with that said . . i will never be back here again ! this place has gone down hill ! ! . do not waste your money here ! ! very disappointed
1," . stars . . . i really enjoyed beckett s table ! it s a large , cool looking room with exposed ceiling and brick walls . they have a small patio and i heard they re planning to build a large patio on the side of the building . i met a couple friends there and we shared a few different items the drink list has some great looking combos and a nice variety of wines . i tried the palmaire , a lemonade pomegranite combo . very refreshing ! we had the grilled cheese with pancetta to start . . . i love a good grilled cheese and these were perfect little bites . it came with roasted red pepper tomato soup . the soup tasted like pureed roasted red peppers i would have preferred a little more balance with tomato taste . the roasted brussel sprouts were sumptuous intense flavor and a little crisp on the outside . the fire roasted green chile pork stew was very tasty . the corn bread that came with had a perfect sweet contrast . i tried a bite of my friend s short rib very tender and lean . we ended with the creme brulee , which came with fresh blackberries . at first i passed on having bites i m not a huge fan of creme brulee , but they pressured me into trying it . . . yum ! i may be a convert now . overall , a great pick ! shout out to katie b . for the suggestion .

1,"if you want a good neighborhood bar , ernie s is exactly that . this is the place i go when i m not looking to get all dolled up but i still want to go out . there is nothing unique about it , it is just a bar that is good at being a bar . it also has all of the best activities for drinking . i love shuffleboard and a dive bar is not a dive bar without it . great thing about theirs is it is in the patio area so you can smoke while playing i smoke when i drink , yes filthy , disgusting habit i m aware . . . sometimes they charge like five bucks for the pucks other times not , depends on the bartender i think . they also have two pool tables , and i think golden tee . their is a room that has karaoke . i am a singer and enjoy karaoke from time to time , the night i participated there were some amazing singers and it was really fun to listen to everyone . the karaoke dj . has a really good selection of songs , lots to choose from you will probably find what you are looking for . i tend to get hit on every time i m there which i guess is an ego boost but i would prefer to be left alone at a place like this . i m usually in the mood to do my own thing with my own friends at a place like this and don t feel like making new friends but that s just me . not sure about their drink selection , i always just get michelob ultra lame i know or cranberry vodka . . . the mixed drinks are strong , their well is gross though but to be expected . always a good laid back time at ernies . they can count on me as a regular .

0,"i don t intend to return , but based on the way we were treated by the kitchen earlier this week , my uncouth self doesn t exactly feel welcome anyway . however , i m not quite convinced that it s my loss . . . it had been almost a year since my original visit to breadfruit which did not overwhelm as you can judge by it taking me a year to make it back but i did have an appreciation of the option for caribbean cuisine . since a friend and i were going to be downtown for an event , i suggested breadfruit for our dinner spot . we enjoy good food and supporting local . the option to pick up wine at the public market next door and have the already reasonable corkage fee waived was a bonus , as we had really enjoyed a couple of the arizona stronghold wines at a recent fnb wine pairing and thought they would pair well with the jamaican heat ! while the scallops were delicious and cooked perfectly , for . . per scallop is a tad steep in my book . we also shared the jerk chicken salad . and the jerk prawns off the grill . . here s the ultimate rub , the bottom of the menu states no substitutions or modifications . . . since when is cutting a kfc side sized ear of corn a modification ? at the same time , the menu describes the restaurant and it s offerings as nothing fancy simply good food that nourishes and rejuvenates the body . it seems like cutting something in half so we could easily share it particularly after the plate has been delivered to the table for us to appreciate it s beauty and after we ve communicated to our server and demonstrated with the first two courses that we were splitting the items is in the vein of nothing fancy . how about providing the customer with an appropriate utensil to cut it themselves , then ? the fact that the chef was obstinate in refusing to cut the kfc side sized ear of corn provided with our entree screams pretentious and grandiose and tainted our entire experience . to quote my dinning companion , you are not james beard and james beard would ve cut the corn !

1,"an unclear menu and chalkboard signage , as well as lack of information from our server , lead to confusion . like most have said before , my friend and i were very pleased with the atmosphere at tryst caf in terms of its decor and layout . however , information about specials on the menu and two separate chalkboards lead to confusion about what specials were available given the day of the week and hour of the day . when we inquired with our server , she didn t know and had to double check what was included , when specials were available and for what price . i m not sure if she was new to this job or just insufficiently trained . fortunately , tryst caf delivered in other ways . the drinks were sufficiently strong . my friend tells me her two glasses of montpellier cabernet savignon pictured were delicious . my tryst pepino was fine , though was missing the mint garnish described on their menu . the humus trio pictured was delicious and came with slices of fresh cucumber however , it did not come with the traditional side of pita bread which had to be ordered separately . the steak salad pictured was amazing and the chunks of meat were oh , so , tender and juicy ! i hope to revisit tryst caf sometime soon . my only hope is that they clear up some of the confusion about what specials are available and appropriately train their staff to know what is actually included , when specials are available and for what price .

1,fantastic venue ! the bartenders are nice the drinks are excellent . the lounge is an amazing place to hang out best downtown spot ? ! even if you aren t going to the show ! cool free shows in the lounge ! now let s talk about the main reason you would go there the music ! and the venue itself is awesome ! the sound is great ! the room is great ! it was designed by someone who knew what concert goers want an intimate experience with fantastic sound . and so if you have the curse of always standing behind the tallest dudes ever at shows you can now take advantage of the bleacher seating in the back of the room or benches on the side . there is not a bad seat in the house ! what is left to say ? get there ! 
1,"okay , eating thai food in what seems to be an old diner is kinda weird . but after getting off of long flights , my mother and i needed some kind of asian food and quick . the gps was taking us to a sushi joint when we drove by this place and we immediately switched gears . i give these guys major kudos for the portion size . seriously , i felt like i was still in texas with such an enormous plate full of pad thai sitting in front of me . and it was delicious plenty of peanuts , the noodles were perfectly cooked , and they didn t skimp on the meat . my mom s soup had to be improvised since they d run out of octopus . they asked her if she wanted to change her order or just double up on the shrimp and she chose the latter . sure , it was tasty , but she was really disappointed . the fried spring rolls were okay , but they were tiny and not piping hot . this was a nice way for us to start our trip and the food hit the spot . it came out quickly and the service was quite friendly though not quite professional . i m all about supporting the mom and pop shops and when the kids are working for the parents , i feel for them even more been there , done that . with a better parking lot and some remodeling to get rid of the weird diner feel , this place will continue to attract more and more clients .

0,"i ve been here a grand total of three times , and i probably won t be returning any time soon . it s not that the food is flat out bad , per se , it s just that there are many better options nearby . the first time i went on a recommendation , and the food was . . . ok . the nd time i went the food was still only . . . ok . the third time . . . well , you get the picture . the first obvious knock against rosita s place is the chips and salsa . they re not bad , but they re not complimentary . given all the competition which offer free chips and salsa , you d think these would have to be pretty darn special , but they re not . good , but not outstanding . secondly , the rice and beans are just ok that descriptor keeps coming up in this review . the chicken enchiladas were fresh , but lacked any real flavor or spice . the machaca , which is supposed to be one of their specialties , was soggy . . . a big no no for a dish that is a specialty in this region . so , honestly , while i wouldn t discourage anyone from going here , i m not sure what some of the hype is about , especially when rito s , tacos de juarez , and comedor guadalajara aren t that far away .

0,"i ve never had a hard time at a sonic before , except for this location . they barely speak english , they don t know their own menu , and they messed up my order times . come on , your job can not be that confusing . . . "
1,really fast and friendly service even during busier moments . the staff is also very helpful when asked to assist with using copiers and finding appropriate mailing supplies . 
1,you can t give anything less than stars to a place that sells bra s and panties to hot chicks . 
1,"rare find in the east valley ! cute cupcakes and the place definitely has character ! i ate a coconut cupcake with sprinkled coconut and glitter on top . i only bought one cupcake and took it hope to share with my roommates . it made me wish i had more cupcakes to share with the rest of them ! we took our forks and gulped it down . the pink frosting was delicious and melted right in our mouth . the cupcake itself was very rich and moist . they must have substituted milk for the water while baking it , i could tell , so moist and mouth watering . i will be coming back here to eat for breakfast and lunch . its a great place to study . "
1,great place to grab a coffee with decent prices and a great atmosphere for sitting down to do some work or catch up with a friend . would definitely recommend ! 
0,"if i ve come to your starbucks over x within months and you still don t bother learning how to pronounce my name correctly then i don t know what to say . i always order the same drink quad espresso with pumps of white mocha and of the time they don t get my order right ! the baristas always ask if i want water or milk with it . . seriously ? i ordered a damn espresso for a reason . if i wanted water or milk then i would ve ordered something else and not an espresso ! and my drink is one of the simplest drinks to make too ! ! just brew shots , mix in white mocha syrup and add ice . . but they always somehow mess up by asking me stupid questions . if it weren t for this sb being the closest to school , i would definitely frequent the thunderbird location !

1,"in the interest of full disclosure the only thing i every really go here for is the lunch buffet but wow , what a great buffet ! i believe the buffet itself is about and for that you get a wide range of vegetarian items and as with other items on the buffet most of those get changed out over time so you get a rotation of various dishes as you come back . they also have hummus and baba ghanoush like hummus but made with eggplant instead of chickpeas . there is generally at least one dish with red meat today it was a tomato based stew with eggplant and either beef or lamb and usually two dishes with chicken . i generally get iced tea to go with the meal and one thing to note , they do not serve alcohol so if you want to go someplace where you can also have a drink or two , this would not be a good place to go but if you just want a place with really good middle eastern food the owners told me it is really lebanese cooking but i m going to just generalize and say for most of us , when you try it , you will think middle eastern . of course , you can walk a block or two to peaks brewery , in the same area , and have a drink or two before or after you your meal . one really nice thing about this place it is right off the apache stop on the light rail and right across the road same side of the street is pita jungle so a wide range of good food options right off that light rail stop . bottom line , i ve never had anyone i ve taken here not like it and everyone who has gone has wanted to go back again . i like it for lunch during the workday because it is quick and you have a wide variety of regularly changed out tasty food options , so i recommend you give it a try if you have the time .

0,"noooo ! ! ! don t think about it ! ! ! ! had my windshield replaced by these schmucks . the morons tore up the interior of my car , and damaged a speaker cover . i had to call them about replacing the cover thrice , they finally did , and then i found out that there was a huge air leak in the corner . they never fixed the interior trim . they sent out the same first idiots to plug the leak , and they ended up breaking a ton of clips for a covering on my car , ruining the windshield wiper covers , and dousing my tweeter in water . i called immediately after they left and got harassed by a manager because he just had hip surgery why is this my fault ? ! and couldnt come until a week out ! whatever incentives they offer are not worth the terrible craftsmanship and poor service . i am exploring my options with a lawyer , and have reported them to bbb .

0,"my g f love sushi ! she made me a connosiuer of it . and i have to be critical . so many college kids love ra , but it s mediocre at best . i ll just list a few things that irk me i went during a happy hour with co workers . it was packed . good thing , right ? wrong ! extremely poor service . when i went in to meet coworkers who already had a table the hostess told me i have to wait . when i said i have a table , she got in my face . i was tired , long day and i wanted to chill . i walked past her , found my friends , and she left me alone . the waitress took quite a bit of time to get around to my table , and the sushi servings were obviously low ! i went to zen , and now my choice is sakebomber . their happy hour servings are much more than ra , and their prices are better ! be ready for loud noises , as every one is trying to talk louder than the music , and the person next to them . just an overall poor experience . and i tip on service . food quality was so so . just don t go during a happy hour , which is the only time it s worth it because it s priced so high . "
1,"had lunch here today with lynn w . and rand h . well the the place is new and the decor is well done and comfy . they have enough food selections to classify them as a super buffet . as far as the food goes it was all pretty good with most of your typical chinese buffet selections . some of the extra items were steamed clams , double baked potatoes , fresh strawberries and vienna sausage . the macaroni salad i had was very good and i went back for more as was the stuffed shrimp . there is also a sushi bar but i did not try any on this trip . the food here makes them a star eatery and as far as the staff goes they need to be a lot more happier with a name like happy buffet .

1,"yoli s has recently been popping up on yelp s best of front page . many people are mouthing out and as the food whore that i am , i needed to go out and try it for myself . my previous research told me that there were many stars and stars reviews regarding the ambiance , service and food . it seemed that the place had be stars for a while but trending analysis showed a decline in the late early . alright enough nerd talk it was a saturday morning , i was starving and i needed a place to have brunch with my lady friend in town . when it comes to brunch at yoli s , you really need to leave all your expectations at the door . the neighborhood its in is a little sub par , the parking situation isn t grand and the interior and patio decor resembles a home that stopped paying for landscaping services a long time ago . the tables outside are all basic basic plastic , they are not squeaky clean or perfectly leveled and the seating is pretty limited . if you are coming to yoli s , you are coming here for the food and nothing else , this ain t no brunch at the four seasons . their menus are strictly breakfast brunch related but at a sided page list , their breakfast choices do have a large variety of flavors and prices . the food is on the stealthier side with skillet dishes , omelets and diner style potato sides . my friend and i ordered their most popular dish , the el monte hawaiian french toast sandwich filled with egg whites , turkey , bacon and cheese with a spicy orange marmalade . at about , the sandwich was pretty large and filled me up easily after just half of it . the french toast itself was soft and spongy and the bacon had some crisp , but the turkey was very thinly sliced deli meat so it didn t have a lot of flavor and the spicy marmalade was tasty but not spicy at all . the service was a tad slow but the lady was very very courteous and nice to us , she just didn t stop by very often so we had to wait around for our drinks and our check for quite a while . overall i wasn t blown away with yoli s but i would recommend as a place with decent portions and good prices . as of now , a . stars on my book . i am a big supporter of local restaurants and i love seeing a family owned business thrive . with a little bit more decor , faster service and a cleaner environment this place can return to be the gem that people used to talk about . yoli , if you are reading this i hope you take this advice , we all want to see you succeed so we hope you can get back on that horse and impress the hell out of us . good luck ! !

1,"the new esplanade is fantastic ! food exceeded my admittedly low expectations . everything packed a lot of flavor , and there was more thought and care put into it than i would normally expect from a restaurant that sources its food from a national distributor . for example , the breadstick that came with the chicken mac n cheese was a soft pretzel . cute , no ? the mac n cheese and chicken fajita wrap were on par with the best meals i ve had at a tgi fridays or applebys . i mean that in the best way possible . . . this is simple whitebread american dining , but it s done well . price points for food and alcohol were competitive with those chains as well . . . most of the meals clocked in under , though soda was almost . service was scary good . push a button , boom ! they re there at your side . our drinks were refreshed before we could finish them . super friendly waitress . their efficiency bordered on supernatural . i mean , it s not like they can just look out over a one room restaurant to see what s going on with their section of tables . so mad kudos to everyone who works there . there are two kinds of theaters , and you have to go to the amc website to know which one your show is playing in . note that the high end theaters are . even the basic level had extraordinarily comfortable seating . seats are arranged there mostly in groups of four . the enormous comfy chairs are worth the slightly higher ticket price . if you go during the day , don t pay the extra to order your tickets from amc s site . otherwise , it s worth it the seats are assigned . my only complaint is that the popcorn only comes in a small bag . refills are unlimited , and you only need to push a button to get more , but it s difficult to share a bag with a group of friends without calling for more every five minutes .

1,love this store ! 
0,"i would not recommend this place to anyone . i went there looking for a gift . i received no help . the girl was too busy helping the wives of the baseball players . i guess you need a large bank account to receive help in this store . also , they did not have a very good selection of items . i think i will take my business to other stores who care about their customers . "
1,"i love this place . what can i say ? richard cho not only has some of the best customer service skills i have ever seen that guy has an amazing memory for names but some of the most creative approaches to making sushi in the valley . i love coming to sushi eye , i have never had a bad experience in all the years i have been going to the x new times best of phoenix award winner . the use of macadamia nuts is brilliant and an amazing addition to many of the creative rolls that are available . the spicy scallop roll is a go to for sure . they have and i know this sounds stupid the best california rolls in arizona . as pedestrian as that roll is , the california roll is transformed in to a very dessert style treat when ordered at sushi eye . seriously , do it . go check it out , introduce yourself to richard and be amazed when he remembers your name . you will be amazed by the food as well .

1,thanks to yelp i was able to read they charge extra for the gas before freaking out on the people at the fron on my way out . the staff was extreemly helpful and even told me there was one open spot close to the front . they were there ready to pick me up before i had my trunk open . the ride was smooth and direct . as long as the car is there when i return this place rocks ! 
0,"i have been to this restaurant several times . i can say it has been better each time with the first time being absolutely terrible . why did i return ? because i was with a friend who wanted to try it and i couldn t believe it would be so bad the second time . it was a bit better and most recently it was good . the hostess initially was very french in that she was affected and snooty and yes , a young american woman . initially we had a very bad experience with a fire alarm that continually went off , the staff didn t apologize and did not comp us anything . other diners just left without paying or waiting for their meal . it has since been better , but i certainly am reluctant to return . there are many other restaurants from which to chose !

0,"so i was meeting some friends here last night for drinks for a friend s birthday . we were supposed to meet at but it was around when we actually got to the bar . we walked in and had our ids checked and then stood around awkwardly . . . i m not sure why this happened , but after a few minutes we were asked if we needed a table . yup . . . that s why we re here . so we were seated near the bar . the place is large and the decor is fine , but the music they were playing was mainly from the s and made the place seem less hip i guess , not that i know much about being hip . we waited for about minutes for anyone to acknowledge us . the waiter finally came by and took our drink order . i got the agave basil margarita . which was soooo good ! i was very happy with the drink . the birthday girl got a blueberry bliss . . . which wasn t what she was expecting . i tried it and thought it was good , but it was definitely more like wine than a mixed drink . the others got beers . so the real problem , for me at least , was my second drink . i got a tropical margarita . . it was one of the worst drinks i have ever had and was a challenge to drink . it was so acidic and just nasty , i swear the two drinks could not have come from the same place . . . but they did . that s a huge red flag for me . side note why do restaurants think it s cool to not price their signature drinks . . . . why should i have to ask how much it costs ? i find this completely ridiculous and annoying . the drinks didn t end up being very expensive here , but i feel like i should have that information available to me on the menu just like any other item . . . . ok steps off soapbox as far as food goes , one of my friends got a side of fries that were pretty good and came with bbq sauce , but other than that we did not eat . i have heard good things about their food from other people . after we were done with our second round of drinks and the fries we decided to move on to another bar . . . . . but we couldn t because we had no check ! our waiter , who had been almost harassing us towards the beginning of our night , had completely disappeared . he finally came by like minutes later and reeked of cigarettes . . . . there is no way he only smoked one because i could almost taste it . . . pretty gross for a waiter . anyway , our checks were brought fairly quickly after that and we were finally able to leave . conclusion be very careful what you order . . . . it is a total mixed bag .

0,"after reading multiple yelp reviews on this business , i decided to come here for the greatest hits pizza muffins , calzones and antipasto salad . i thought the pizza muffins were interesting and a great alternative to bread sticks or garlic bread . they were loaded with tons of sausage and ham and came with different dipping sauces . although a little greasy and re heated , i appreciated the novelty factor . on to the entrees , the small antipasto salad . was absolutely filling for a one person meal . i didn t find it any different from any antipasto salad i have tried before , but i think people love it for the dressing which had flavor but a lot of oil more than half of the total dressing . the ingredients were fresh but there is nothing out of this world about iceberg lettuce and dry mozzarella . the calzone was larger than a newborn baby and hotter than phoenix in the summertime . although the corners are mostly if not all bread the taste was very good and overloaded with tasty insides . the spinach ham combo my friend ordered was pretty satisfying and this meal could easily be split in for tasty leftovers . . . if you can stop eating . i found the teenage staff to be friendly and cheery but the bathroom needs massive help . only one stall and really unpleasant smells , the female employee who had just left the bathroom as i entered left wet paper towels on the handles of both exit doors . . . covering the entire area for me to hold on to and pull . just . . . . disgusting , especially from an employee who should be trying to keep the establishment clean and good looking . all in all , good but not great . its pretty affordable so if this is your price range , i think you can make it work and still have a tasty meal .

1,"this place is fast becoming a favorite happy hour stop for my fiance and i . service is friendly , the panini s are delish and the bruschetta is to die for . anything with their yummy fig jam is amazing . i love the ambiance . very casual , trendy and lively with great outdoor and indoor seating . i d say service is on the slow side , but it s understandable b c the place is always packed . they have pretty good happy hour deals . i will say that the parking situation kind of sucks valet only unless you want to park down the street . but other then that , i have no complaints and will definitely be back !

0,"went to sol for restaurant week . was less than impressed with the bitter salad with mia avocados , the carnitas that were very bland and boring , the rice was delicious , however the black beans tasted like aspirin , dessert was a dulche flan that was hard , solid and icky . service was average , took hours to get thru dinner . best part was the refreshing wine and beer ! cheers to sol , we wont be returning .

0,"very bad service below average sushi stars . the stars is because the quality of food is below average and not that great . the salmon looks like its been on the plates forever and has a real slimy look . i ve had way better sushi in some all you can eat places ! ! basically the only good thing is the gimmick with the conveyor belt . i would advise the reader to save his her money for a better sushi place like kabuki . the next bad thing about this place is the atrocious service . they never bring you the drinks or seat you in a timely manner . god knows what the waitresses do over there . . . they run around as if its their first day at work and never get anything done like clear tables , get checks etc . i ve been here a couple of times and i saw that the nd time , the patrons were not even waiting for the waitresses . . . they formed a line at the cashier like denny s .

1,"i had a lot of fun at this place . you know you aren t getting authentic sushi so you put those expectations aside . this is a great place for groups like bday parties . the restaurant isn t that big and they don t take reservations so you end up waiting a while , especially on weekends . we went on a sunday night around pm and had to wait almost an hour . i recommend getting the sushi boats which is basically an assortment of sushi . it s a pretty good value for the price . the miso marinated cod is fantastic , but the shrimp , scallops and garlic spinach dish is just ok . the scallops dynamite is really rich . the restaurant is noisy inside so it s not a place for a quiet or romantic date .

1,for our first time we had a great time ! our server was very knowledgable about the menu especially the drink menu . culinary dropout has to have some off the most creative drinks i ve seen in a while . everyone mentioned the pretzels on yelp and they were right ! the cheese sauce was velvety and delicious and the pretzel bites had the perfect texture . my girlfriend and i both couldn t finish our sandwiches because they are pretty big . i will definitely be going back to try the charcuterie menu .

0,"ive been to f h on numerous occasions . the night usually goes a little like this . . i walk up to the entrance , i see people smoking outside in a small fence area . i look over and see these groups are starring at me like i just blatantly readjusted myself in public . i give them one more glance and realize in two hours we all will all be best friends exchanging pointless stories about our days when in reality i couldn t give a flying f [ about their new kitten they adopted and named bunbun . but in hours i will thrive and cherish each of their stories and be amazed i never found such intellectual people sooner . before i get to the door i feel eyes spying on me . i look up to find one of hostesses peering through the window ready to yank the door open a mere second before i reach for it . you can t beat them to this . . ive tried several times , they are good at what they do . just prepare for this and accept it . as i step inside my eyes automatically affix to the bar top . i scan up and down the row of seats . as i m scanning down i see two empty seats . i m not sure if guy code applies to bar seats like the bathroom urinals guys . . you know what i m talking about . . but i usually just start the night off not giving a . . . because i already aknowledge the fact things are only going to degrade from here anyways . i start with a tall miller light and look up at the game playing on the tv s . i continue my beer almost empty then order some beer battered buffalo chicken tenders with extra ranch . i look into the reflection of my phone to make sure my face isn t suddenly disfigured because she looks at me as if i just asked for an order of wine and chive biscottes . i explain that i am looking to get the beer battered buffalo wings then she calls for backup like i m speaking a foreign language . hey lacey ! this guy wants beer battered buffalo chicken wings they say some things , fumble a bit then come back with . . so you want chicken tenders and ranch ? . i explain again to the both of them . they both tilt their heads to the side . either this one beer slammed me , and i m speaking nonsense at this point , or they just don t understand what buffalo wings are . so . . you want a cheeseburger and a side of buffalo sauce sir ? . they do a little further team planning and come up with a solution and i end up with beer battered chicken tenders dry as a bone with no sauce and a side of buffalo sauce . my friend getting the opposite when we both ordered the same thing except he gets no buffalo sauce and a side of ranch . . i find it to bother me less and less each time because i expect it now . their food really is good , and their service is . . . did i mention that their food is really good ? i look back up at the tv acting real smooth and care free only to realize ive been watching female tennis on the television next to me for the past minutes while everyone eise is attentively watching the football game . i m not ashamed to admit that i continued watching it . i think it was the loud grunts that kept my attention . i finish eating , grab another beer and me and the friend approach the ping pong table . you need to go to the hosts stand to get the equipment . it s free . wait no it s not . . it s a dollar . nope that was last month . now it s bucks an hour . better empty those pockets . just remember every hour you waste playing you could have fed starving ethiopians for a month . but in your drunken stooper you chose to dish out the like myself and play pool or ping pong . shame on you . ps . . , beware of the twins . . . i thought i was loosing my mind after a few beers seeing one girl cover the whole restaurant in a matter of mere seconds . if you ask your server for something and she looks at you funny . . . it s either because you asked her twin , or you asked for buffalo chicken tenders . also . . . if you stay late enough the cops hide and wait for you to leave the parking lot as soon as you turn out . but of course you have a designated driver . . . right ? overall , the food i have ordered was great . the service was . . . the food was really good .

1,"mostly i love the rokerij just because i love saying the name . but the food is also killer . i had the most amazing chicken , and the sides , which usually i just take for granted as filler food , were sodelicious that they caught my attention in a big way . i also tried my date s steak , and while it was fairly spendy , it sure seemed worth it . the feel of the place is great too , with the dark stone walls and coziness without feeling too crowded . we ventured downstairs to look at the bar , and had we been there early enough to snag a couch i wouldn t have wanted to leave . it definitely feels like a splurge , or somewhere you d take a business associate or date that you wanted to wow . it s manages a high end feel , while remaining unmistakably local . i can t say i d suggest it just for any old night , but it will stay on top of my list for special occasions .

0,"the valet guys were absolutely awesome . they were the best part of my stay at this hotel . the grounds were okay not star quality . the decor in the rooms seemed old , and the color scheme was dated . although most of the staff was friendly , we did have a pretty bad encounter with the pool manager . my husband and i had bought a bag of popcorn at the grocery store and were snacking on it poolside . the pool manager came up to us and informed us that outside food is not allowed in the pool area . she told us that we needed to put our food away . she then left without even offering the opportunity to order some fairmont approved food . it was really strange and off putting . we had been sitting by the pool for over an hour and not a single person from the wait staff had come up to us to take our drink food orders . also , it seems a bit ridiculous that we can t eat our own bagged popcorn . it s not like we were chowing down on a big meal and making a mess . it made the resort seem elitist . i definitely won t be staying here again . i ve stayed at the hyatt regency scottsdale before and would definitely recommend that hotel over the fairmont scottsdale princess .

1,been here twice now and tried two different dogs and two sides . nothing was disappointing . i have tried both the sweet and spicy dog and the hana dog . both dogs were great and had very distinct high points . the sweet and spicy does something very rare for me and actually gets me to enjoy pineapple mixed with other foods . i this dog had great flavors all over including the dog itself which was perfectly cooked and the right amount of heat . the hana was just a stack of messy amazingness that had a real mexican flair . the bacon is the real standout adding the great bacon flavor and a crunch that gives the textures some depth . the sides were good to . the chili is not some canned stuff and is good . the tater tots are just awesome though and nice crispy outside and that soft pillowy inside you crave . if you want a gourmet hot dog this place is not going to let you down .

1,"this is one excellent ethiopian restaurant , rivals anything i ve sampled in washington dc or seattle . if i lived in phoenix , this would be a top restaurant for me along with lo lo s chicken waffles yum ! . lalibela takes a slightly different approach to their menu . many of the entrees are offered as small portions . . each . they suggest each diner order of these to make a meal . kitfo and lamb tibs dishes are offered as full entrees and like many ethiopian restaurants , you can order combo plates meat combo , veggie combo , house combo plate etc . . this made deciding on our meal a little more complicated , but also offered more flexibility for sampling different dishes . our favorite dish ordered was the lamb tibs the spicy version with awaze spice paste . lamb was soooo tender , and the spices were a delight rich in flavor but not too hot for those with tame palettes . good thing it comes as a full order four of us were competing for bites ! ! we ordered a half portion of keye wott beef in a spicy brown sauce that was some of the best i ve ever had . again , rich in flavor but not too spicy . my favorite ethiopian meat dish is kitfo choice beef sort of like steak tartar servered raw or lightly cooked but with ethiopian spices . lalibela s was pretty good , just not transcendent like the lamb tibs or beef keye wott . the vegetable dishes were on a whole excellent especially the yellow lentils , gomen collard greens and spicy wott lentils . staff was great attentive , helpful service . unlike some ethiopian restaurants , this one is very user friendly . although in some cases the menu accommodates american tastes it doesn t compromise on quality or authenticity . one note on the injera sponge like bread used to scoop up the entrees it s a mix of wheat flour and teff a grain indigenous to ethiopia and i don t think it s fermented like injera that is made with teff . i m used to the latter , but you can argue lalibela s injera doesn t compete with the flavor of the entrees as much . all in all , one of the best ethiopian restaurants i ve been to , and i have been to many in the states . only problem now is whether my favorite ethiopian restaurants in seattle will still taste as good ! highly , highly recommended .

0,"lets satrt with the good , the brisket was a solid on a point scale . i didnt like much else about a place even though i have been wanting to try for some time . it was cold and rainy today and i really wanted some comfort food just as i was passing be bbq . so i stopped in and sat at the bar . from the moment i walked in and sat down the poorly trained bartender struggled with every step . it was also very obvious that the well trained staff was frustrated with him to no end . the bartender knocked a plate of food out of one servers hand a the entrence to the kitchen , he couldnt settle a check with special instruction twice , and his amaturish drink pouring skills shined bright on this cold and cloudy day . ok yelpers i admit im a years restaurant veteran and maybe thats why i was so stressed out watching the goings on but he things i was seeing was like a train wreck ! but i just couldnt help but watch . on to the food , i had extreemly high expectaions about the food and i even expected the prices to be on the scottsdale side of high . what i wasnt expecting was the tiny bbq brisket sandwich , and i mean like bites tiny . the bbq sauce was so heavy with chili powder and with almost no vinager it was gritty . the fries served with the sadwich were also covered with tons of chili powder . the meat itself was tender and flavorfull and well smoked , but i was surprised that it was a cold , that was a turn off , but not as much as the small chintzy portion . well at least big earls is off my bucket list of must try restaurants , and as far as bbq options in scottsdale well that list is certainly shorter too .

0,"i usually shop at this store because it is the most convenient and has the best prices and selection in the area . for staple goods such as bread , milk , eggs , meats , and canned goods , the prices are usually lower than the other large grocery stores . their branded goods kroger such as condiments are usually good quality compared to store brands at other stores . however , in the last few years , vegetable prices have skyrocketed other than tomatoes , celery , and lettuce so i find myself driving several miles away to a healthy food specialty store to stock up . this fry s was recently renovated , seemingly to make it more difficult to find the items you are looking for , and making what should be a quick trip in an out into a half hour ordeal . the aisles also seem to be harder to navigate , with bulky displays jutting out here and there , and it s difficult to get around other customers . what i do like is that there are four self checkouts so you usually don t have to wait in lines . i also like fry s policy of charging you the price on the shelf tag , or you get the item free . i ve often walked out with cash in my pockets when i went in with none . sometimes due to the confusing vip customer pricing on the receipt , it s a bit difficult to tell if you paid the right price . read your receipt carefully !

0,"simple , inexpensive and within walking distance from my place . i went biking this evening and had the sudden urge to get chinese food . i ordered something to go and got a vegetarian dish with tofu . from what i ve observed , the place is simple and clean . now as far as my dish goes i thought it was good , but needed more flavor . which is a good thing it gave me a good reason to infuse my dish with bragg s liquid amino which is healthier than other seasonings . my only complaint is the edename in the vegetarian dish . why do they have to include the shell ? i don t like unwrapping them with my teeth ! p . . ^ , o . pass the soy sauce please ! ` \ ` "
1,"huge fan ! love poncho , the birthday strobe lights , the food and the service . this is a go to for my boyfriend and i when we re looking for sushi . more likely than not , we ll opt for the all you can eat option for person . with that comes with miso soup , salad , sashimi , your ayce picks , ice cream and with a special frequent customer request , this awesome pan seared , naturally fatty sea bass belly and salmon cheeks , which are amazing . not a taste for everyone , kinda bizarre for most . but this will be well appreciated by traditional asian taste and perfect for me . loyalist here .

1,"i d have to say that among the restuarants in the tom jetland suite fez , ticoz , switch , ticoz is my favorite because of its dimly lit lounge like quality , which provides it a cozier feel than the other two . add to that , the hypnotic mojito creations and ticoz is one of those places i could spend an entire weekend late afternoon at , as long as someone else drives , of course . the tamales are fantastic and are more similar to corn pudding than to traditional hand rolled tamales . if you get them with veggies , you ll find that the veggies are a little oddly cut for the dish , so i recommend some other topping . the beef is fantastic especially in the tacos . all in all , this is one of my current favorites .

0,"i ve known my way around sky harbor airport since i was years old and terminal was an actual terminal . in the time since then , their attempts to improve the airport , transportation and parking , and terminals have made it extremely confusing . get in the wrong lane and you ll end up in the parking garage , when all you wanted was to drop off someone at the departures curb . terminal remains the most accessible , with a parking lot located across the street and few airlines stationed there . because only a couple airlines now use this terminal , security is a breeze . however , it s the oldest terminal , smells bad like rotten pizza and doesn t appear clean . terminal a little more of a hassle , although they have a parking garage attached to the terminal allowing you to enter any level through the elevator . more airlines use this terminal and it s much smaller than terminal , making it easier to navigate . oh , terminal . you re so nice , new and clean . you have access to great restaurants like flo s shanghai cafe , einstein s , quizno s and more . i love taberna del tequila for a drink just prior to my flight inside security access i don t like to fly , i prefer a bloody mary prior to boarding . you have tons of shops from borders books to local az tourist junk . i would like to love you , but you are just a mess . it s way to difficult to navigate your lanes to get where you re going , pick up and drop off is dangerous due to the people who pull away from the curb into lanes without looking , and security is painful not only is there always a long line , but tsa agents regularly yell at people to pay attention ! i dread flying out of terminal because i have to leave extra early for all the bs . there are much easier airports to navigate and use , but we re stuck with sky harbor . i can only hope the light rail access once complete will help in making it a more user friendly airport .

1,"this is not very far from my home , but for some strange reason , i have never visited there . maybe because we don t have new york deli s in spokane , and i m not familiar with the idea . the other day , i agreed to meet my son and little granddaughter there for coffee and a bagel , and found that it is much more than just a bagel stop . they actually have a restaurant with quite an extensive menu . i had breakfast the choices were very diverse including skillets , various pancakes , bagels of course , french toast , omelets , and a number of other items . the servings were large , and the service very prompt and friendly . most importantly , the prices were more than reasonable . the only thing that i disliked , was that they did not have hash browns . they do have potatoes as an option with the meals , but you cannot actually classify them as hash browns . they are good but not quite a replacement for hash browns and gravy . i actually like it so much , that i stopped and had breakfast two days later on the way to the golf course . again , great breakfast at very reasonable prices . although i usually don t eat lunch , i am going to have to make an effort to stop in and try their lunch menu . and their deli counter , and all the different varieties of bagels .

1,"this restaurant is inside the baiz market ! so , don t waste your time trying to gps it just gps baiz market ! secondly , ambiance or quick service are probably not the reasons you d come to eat inside an outdated restaurant on styrofoam plates . the food , however , is pretty tasty . they have a wide variety of items typical to middle eastern cuisine shawarmas , falafel , kebabs , pies , and more . they heat items up in an open oven and the food comes out very fresh and hot ! i tried the cheese pie and shawarma . both items were very good . i still got onions when i asked for them to be excluded . i suggest skipping their small beverage options in the adjacent cooler and going to the selection on the south side of the store for a better deal and variety . all in all , it is definitely worth trying out , especially if you are going to baiz market anyway !

0,"my biggest tip for newbies to yc s , look toward the grill and look up . there you will find a nice little menu of sauce formulas . unfortunately , i never looked up . as a result , i didn t have enough sauce . in my case , that was a good thing because the sauce i did have tasted like crap , so more of the same would have been even crappier . as for the ingredients , lots of choices with fresh veggies . i have to say the meat looked unappetizing to me . in fact , i had to ask my husband what the hell it was . i guess it s a good thing you don t see piles of freshly sliced meat , else it might not be so fresh after all . but in its frozen to minus degrees f state , i found i opted for more veggies . two sizes available . i went with the large , crammed my bowl full until it resembled a small mountain , and then wasted over half of it . so get the small unless you want leftovers or you haven t eaten in several days .

1,"saigon pho doesn t have a fancy sign , great decor or even windows you can look in out of . but who cares when you have the most amazing pho in the valley and at the best prices ? the servings are very big and everything averages about a plate . staff is very attentive and quick to deliver the goods . as you can read through the various other reviews everyone has a favorite dish . i have a problem with gluttony so i can t suggest a single dish i can only suggest them all . however , this place also has some of the best salt and pepper calamari i ve ever had .

0,"for frozen yogurt quality , i give this place a one . honestly , it s small , there s very little variety in terms of toppings , and the yogurt tastes cheap . . . probably because it s a big franchise . there is a reason why you re paying less for an ounce . . . truly you get what you pay for . the concept is neat , sure , but if you re looking for pizzazz then you should try yogurtini . . . it s just up the road from yogurtland . anyway , the single star says it all . . . eek ! methinks not .

1,"we used the taco cart for my th birthday this past weekend and we came away very impressed . eduardo was the guy that came to our fiesta , and he was incredible . when he arrived , we experienced a haboob and he immediately stepped in and helped bring in our decorations and furniture . he waited about minutes until serving because we were unsure if the haboob was going to attack again . my wife and i are both in the restaurant biz and so were many of the guests , we all came away impressed with the food quality . next time we throw a party , we will use them again ! make sure to get the el pastor and carnitas . great job hector eduardo .

1,"i m not normally one to jump at reviewing a chain restaurant , especially when there are subways all within a couple blocks of each other . i felt it was necessary in this case . my husband and i came here over the weekend after a lovely trip to the dog park . the two guys working here on the lonely afternoon were awesome . they were really nice and friendly , and quite chatty . one of them started helping my husband and the other one was sweeping while i was deciding . the sweeping boy apparently noticed i was ready and he quickly ran to the back , washed his hands , threw on gloves and asked me what i wanted . wow ! this type of service has never happened at the other locations , all of which i have been too . he chatted with me as i told him what i wanted . he also joked about my weird sandwich and made me laugh . it s refreshing to see a couple guys working on a boring day and actually enjoying themselves . they also have outdoor seating which are perfect to sit at and people watch on beautiful days . we even met this incredible year old guy who is blind and deaf in both ears but somehow managed to communicate with us perfectly . he was much more lively than most twenty somethings you meet . amazing . only in downtown do you meet people like that . this is a great subway . go here and skip the others .

1,"pita jungle is a great place to get inexpensive mediterranean food as long as you don t mind a bit of a wait . the food usually gets served up really fast , but then your waiter leaves and never comes back . i m not ususally a stickler for outstanding wait service , but i do like to get my glass refilled and be given my check in a timely manner . never the less , the food is so good it makes up for any other flaws .

1,"the more times i visit my son , the more sports bars i get introduced to in the phoenix area . if nothing else , i know my son doesn t go to dive sports bar . this is another upscale sports bar he introduced to mom and dad . we went to lunch on a saturday around pm . the restaurant was not crowded , a light crowd on a sunny beautiful degree ? phoenix day . my son was meeting some people in the area , so my wife and i had a light lunch and he met us afterwards . what we had lunch size ahi crunch and french onion soup with salad and iced green tea . that was it for my wife and i . total plus tax . . we weren t very hungry this day . as others have said , if you want beer , lots of variety and want to come back every day for for two years and never repeat your beer order , this is the place to visit . if you want to have a party for the football season , or any type of sporting event , have it here , they offer a good variety of party platters , and it s not your regular wings and potatoe skins and fried veggies and cheese thingys . party platters offered moo shu egg rolls , seared rare ahi sashimi , thai chicken noodle , penne with chicken and peach apple cobbler just to name a few items . a place like this , i could get use to going whether or not there s a sporting event going on . i read there is at least one in denver colorado area if not two . i will definitely check it out . our server was very friendly and it was very relaxing to sit out on the patio for lunch . we will definitely come back to the yard house , whether it s here or in denver to see further what yard house has to offer"
1,"i came to timo for my birthday last week after hearing rave reviews about it from a few friends of mine . i met up with the fabulous jennifer t . and i was so happy to check this place out ! i like any place that i get to walk in through a back door . i passed through the very chill looking patio area first , another plus in my book . plenty of outdoor seating that looked dangerously inviting once this hot hot heat cools off . inside was intimate , but with the large windows , it wasn t dark and depressing . like your own little happy wine bar world . they have an amazing wood burning oven . normally , that itself is plenty good enough , but then there s the food that comes out of that wonderful oven . i only tried the spinach and artichoke dip , which was the best i have ever had ! it didn t have a pool of oil first time for everything ! , it was so fresh , and i really appreciated seeing the bread sliced fresh right in front of us , since we were sitting at the bar . i saw several other things flatbread come out of that oven , and i will have to go back to try them ! everything smelled delicious and was presented with a touch of class without being pretentious . i was also very intrigued by the eggplant dip which is apparently better than baba ! now for the drinks . holy cow . i ve been drinking a few years now , so safe to say , i ve tried many , many drinks . or so i thought . coconut mojito anyone ! ? made with ciroc coconut vodka ! as tasty as mojitos are , i don t get a long well with rum , so vodka was a pleasant surprise , and the coconut just brought the mmmmmazing factor to a whole new level . i also tried the white sangria , another stars . great wine list too apothic red is one of a few reds i like , and they have it ! the staff was top notch as well . i arrived shortly before a shift change , and both bartenders were personable and hard working , and truly seemed to enjoy what they were doing . i m pretty bad with names unfortunately , or i would love to mention them . i can t wait to go back ! for drinks and food ! i think i d even go alone for lunch if i didn t have any company !

1,"i really like this place . . . taking the advice of yelp we stopped in on our way through downtown . we were immediately greeted as we walked in . i told the staff it was our first time in and asked which sandwich was the best . following the recommendation i ordered the crackerjack , cracked pepper turkey and melted pepper jack cheese with lettuce , tomato , onion and russian dressing . we also ordered the godfather , cappicola , salami , pepperoni and melted mozzarella on garlic toasted bread . let s take a moment and show the bread some much deserved love . it tastes fresh with a chewy center and crisp exterior covered in sesame seeds . you could put a shoe on this bread and it would taste great . i really enjoyed the crackerjack . the godfather was good for a few bites , but too rich for me . i can t wait to come back . . . great choice for lunch downtown for a very fair price . unless you are completely starving , share a sandwich !

0,"let s put it this way . . . i ordered two topping heavy small pizzas from naked pizza . i had a groupon for that only cost me . so , keep in mind i am rating this on my entire experience that cost me merely out of pocket . the good ? the garlic topping is delicious . the employees were friendly . they were generous with their toppings . the bad ? daiya cheese is disgusting on this pizza and tasted like raw dough . if you re off dairy , get the pizza sans cheese . it will probably be a lot better ! the just okay ? the crust was okay tasting , if not a little plain and dry . the sauce was pretty good for one of us and just okay for the other . this is one of the two times in my life that i have ordered pizza and not kept the leftovers . of two adults and three kids eating the two small pizzas , we were left with one and a half pizzas , which we promptly tossed in the bin . my daughter disliked this pizza so much , she picked off a few of her toppings and then told me she was full when she said earlier how famished she was . i am only rating this pizza two stars versus one because i can see that it would be better without the daiya cheese that i chose to have on the pizza instead of mozzarella .

0,"stopped here for lunch with my bff today . nowhere to park , forced to valet , meh . . . love the atmosphere here classy decor , beautiful patio . everything on the menu looked delicious . i had a hard time choosing between many foods that i love crab cakes , goat cheese , crepes . . . i wanted something lighter so i ordered the oriental chicken salad . in the meantime , our drinks were brought to the table . bff pulled the spoon out of her iced tea to find that there was some leftover peanut butter still on it . the question is who left it there ? don t know . gross . this was pointed out to a server not ours because she had not returned to our table . our server brought out a new iced tea . she was polite , but not necessarily apologetic . when our meal was delivered to the table , bff pointed out that there were tomatoes on her sandwich she asked for no tomatoes . the server said that the other server probably grabbed the wrong plate . she came back from the kitchen twice to tell us that the new sandwich would be right out . so , i sat with my salad and waited to eat until bff got her meal it took a good minutes for her new sandwich to come out . bff raved about the dressing on her side salad . my salad was fine , but nothing to rave about especially not for . the ingredients were fresh but the shredded chicken that was described on the menu appeared to be sliced chicken breast . to be honest , i prefer shredded chicken which is why i had decided on that particular salad . disappointing . the server arrived at the table to ask if we wanted to order dessert . we replied , no , thank you . and she said something like , oh , come on , are you sure ? . again , we declined but i really think she should have offered us free dessert after our bummer lunch . the topper ? valet guy and people in line to pick up their cars a minute wait just to leave the place . i would hesitate to come back , but that menu is just so damn tempting .

0,"went last night to whore foods to get basics to make pizza with , most clutch to the process was a three pack of yeast . low and behold , the dirty hippie kids they have working there again didn t put something in the bag . and this time it was the yeast . i love the food there , but the employees are nothing more than entitled hippie kids from scottsdale who can t be bothered to do their goddamn jobs ! i am so sick of this crap with this corporation . maybe its a phoenix thing , or maybe its the hiring and firing processes of whore foods , but i am done shopping at any whore foods . in a place like phoenix , where you have alternatives such as sprouts , you d think whore foods would smarten up . or when you try to ask someone who works here where something is , and they just walk by with their nose high in the air . i understand its important to show your fellow dirt merchants that you re a super star , but i don t work with you , i contribute to your salary and over inflated set of benefits for a grocery clerk , so do your goddamn job . useless little girl in need of a shower and orthodontist . but alas , whore foods and its dirty hippie employees have alienated yet another person with a job and a degree into hating everything that place stands for . oh yea , one other thing , take the concealed firearm prohibition off of your stores . it didn t stop jared loughner from doing something horrid , and all it does is alienate law abiding citizens from their constitutional rights . i understand you think that only parts of the constitution should apply , but honestly i think you need to pull your collective heads out of your ass and take a shower . useless motherf s !

0,"after vine expressions closed many of us have tried this place . i like new things and love different types of cuisine but this place doesn t hit the spot . it s nice to go somewhere and get a wine list by the glass where you can choose a wine you enjoy but of course you want to know the freakin vineyard . not here . by the glass , the list just has varietals shiraz , cab , etc . they change their list a lot but so do many places . the food below average . tried the stew that they said was great and famous . bland . the sliders were like eating a salt lick , too salty . the servers are nice but they tend to ramble on and give you a minute dissertation on the menu and why you shouldn t look at the last page because it s not available yet but they want you to know it s there . finally , a few people mentioned the sucky chairs . boy , they weren t kidding . they have many stools at tables with no back . customers should be comfortable , this is not . the seats with backs have as much padding as a x . bottomline , uncomfortable . you want better options , here you go . the living room in chandler , my wine cellar in ahwatukee , postino in arcadia , th and wine in old towne , kazimierz in old towne , and terroir wine pub in n scottsdale . been to all of them and all significantly better . tons more on yelp . postino is supposedly opening where grainbelt used to be across from joe s bbq in downtown gilbert so when that s there a local joint should be available .

1,"loving this place since i was a kid . stopped eating meat three years ago , so i miss the jerk fried rice and carnitas and emerald chicken , but the veggie quesadilla with black beans and white rice is amazing with their tasty red salsa . always amazing customer service and it s great that they let you taste everything before you commit . they should lighten their footprint and reduce food packaging . i always feel guilty when i leave with all that aluminum and styrofoam . btw , don t be swayed by offers of other cookies snickerdoodles are where it s at .

1,"i discovered this hidden gem while shopping at tj s and returned for happy hour between and from t f . the patio is in the afternoon shade and far enough off scottsdale road to avoid street noise . the seven tapas appetizers attracted my interest and i ended up selecting ebi prawn with grilled fennel , tartine of bouillabaisse and medjul dates with merguez sausage , sugar cured bacon for the happy hour price of for vs the normal for . the single prawn was large and equal in quality to the fresh prawns i had just tasted in new zealand plus the fennel added more flavor . the tartine of bouillabaisse was mostly small shrimp but again very tasty and tempting to order a bowl the next time around . the three medjul dates with sausage bacon was an unusual combination to my culinary experience and superb in flavor . the select wines were about half the normal price and a definite value at per glass . in talking with the waiter i noticed there is live jazz on fridays between and . i will definitely have to return on a friday to try the other tappas and listen to the swedish singer who sings some songs in german . . . see tappas photo . . . update happy hour season ended this week . . . tappas special no longer available but the thin crust pepperoni makes a good starter . entrees are in the range . . .

1,"cork is an enigma . what makes it enigmatic is how damn good it is . . . too good for chandler and maybe too good for the valley . the portions are just right , and anybody that tells you otherwise is a fat ass or a glutton i m , lbs . and i was satisfied . if you want large portions though , go to their lunch brunches . i ve been there twice and had the lamb chop , which was amazing on all levels , and i ve had some serious lamb in rural bosnia , which has been labeled the best in their country . . . sure enough cork s stood up blow for blow . the other entr e i experienced was the buttermilk fried chicken . i was so amazed by the lamb the first time , that i had to try something more simple in order to qualify their food in regards to regular places . let s just say the chicken was not regular , it was outstanding . the appetizers are crazy good . . . can anyone say king crab legs ? the wine selection is top notch . the booze selection is killin , and they even make this amazing italian lemon stuff that s like alcohol . make sure you have a designated driver , because this place will inspire winos and boozers to indulge to their fullest . go to cork , because it s that damn good !

1,"as a visitor to scottsdale , i thought a stroll through the farmers market was a great way to get a taste of the local flavor literally . and it was ! there s a great mix of vendors , who sell everything from baked goods to coffee , from vegan wraps to preserves . there are also some interesting services like pet massages ! like vicky t . said , it was surprising to see dogs with their owners wandering through the farmers market , because that s against code in california . but i thought it was great , and with the pet masseuse and a doggy and kitty treat vendor , it totally made sense . farm sessions , where local chefs give cooking demos with produce from the market , is a great idea i d like to see at my local farmers market . it did seem odd , though , that all the produce at the market was in one corner . it was the shadiest spot , so maybe that s why ? anyway , this was a great way to spend a saturday morning and was very relaxing compared to my local farmers markets , where i often feel like i need to start throwing some elbows to get through the crowd .

1,"i have been to every ballpark in the cactus league and know my way around them all . this is , by far , the best facility in all of spring training that includes the florida parks . granted , i am a dodger fan and we get it better than the sox fans do , but it is still amazing . camelback ranch is the brand new , state of the art , spring training facility for the dodgers and white sox . the sox moved from tucson because tucson is the literally so bad that even people from chicago won t stay there . the park is located just south of the glendale airport and pretty much only has one way in or out th ave . you can avoid camelback rd by taking indian school to th and then just drive into the stadium . the grounds feature practice fields and a giant lake and river that also help irrigate the fields . while the white sox practice fields and clubhouse entry are blocked off from the public , the dodgers are wide open and inviting . players must walk through the crowds during practices which invited lots of interaction with the fans . the field is beautiful and the layout of the stadium is quite impressive . not only do they have a full jumbotron but they also feature fully enclosed suites and a full buffet for those willing to shell out per game . that price gets you seats behind home , access to unlimited food , wine , beer , soda , and sweets . it also gets you exclusive merchandise as well as cold towels to help you cool off . it sounds like a lot but it turns out to be worth the money . the grass seats have a great slope to them much like scottsdale and the seat aisles are wide . the food selection is lacking without dodger dogs , however . the stadium is also missing the independent food vendors that maryvale and peoria feature . a great stadium and surely one to visit every march .

1,"i stayed here with my family people in room for nights . what first attracted us was the rate , but what made us happy with the choice was the cleanliness , coolness literally good air conditioning , and accessibility of the hotel . it s wheelchair accessible . the best part of the hotel is the staff . the front desk team was incredibly helpful much more so than you typically see at a chain hotel and they gave us regular maps handouts as well as printouts that were tailored individually for our needs . even more astounding , though , was the cleanliness of the room the staff cleaned the room so well after our first night that when we returned on day two , it looked like we had just walked into the room for the first time . in my experience , most hotels do a better clean up job in between guest stays rather than do a good job every single day , but these folks are the exception . reasonable , hot breakfast . eggs , swine , cereals , pastries , juice , milk , coffee , fruit , yogurt . . . you ve had it a million times , but they do it just fine . the definition of stars is yay ! i m a fan . and that s true . didn t give it stars because it s not woohoo ! as good as it gets ! to me mostly a product of the location and lack of distinctiveness as a hotel experience i would only give stars to an excellent destination hotel , and that s not this place .

1,"this is a dangerous place for me . i could seriously do my bank account some damage as i love love love this store ! the candles are the best anywhere . they burn very clean and the fragrance lasts until they burn out . i just bought the kumquat scented candles and they smell delish . there s so many cool home furnishings here as well , unique non mainstream stuff that s fairly reasonable in . i ve actually got my eye on this really cool apothecary cabinet . . . purchasing it may be in my very near future !

1,"thai , vietnamese a nice patio , good happy hour and a swanky inside they have it all . despite being a nicer place as asian food goes the prices are quite reasonable and it is really a great value . the happy hour menu has asian tappas apps for and many cocktails and glasses of wine . we had the salmon satay which was just grilled cubes of salmon on a stick with sauce and some salad , good but nothing special . the veggie wontons were great in a brown sauce and filled with veggies and again a small salad garnish . my cocktail was great but it was a bit strong . for our mains we had the salmon with green curry , it came in a huge bowl it was rich and full of great veggies and fresh not overcooked fish . . we also had the dragon noodles , which was veggies tofu and glass noodles . it was light and fresh . over all great quality value and patio i will be back .

1,"i have a serious banana republic problem . rewind time to about three years ago when i bought my first dress from br . i had just gotten my first full time real job after finishing college and i needed a wardrobe to match my new position . it is now three years later and i have probably close to twenty dresses from br . the only issue i have is they leave me pretty darn broke , so when i heard br had a factory store i was stoked ! so last weekend i dragged my husband , sister and niece down to anthem to check this place out . it was crowded , but the prices of the items definitely make up for it . that is , when you find something worth buying . the selection of items is a little weird , and you have to fight with many other women to get into the racks with the good stuff . but i managed to find two cotton dresses that are both casual and work appropriate at the same time . priced originally at with a markdown to on the rack , they also had a off sale on these particular items that day . so i scored two dresses originally totaled for for . sounds like a good deal to me . i wish they had more colors , except that would have been bad for my credit card cause i am sure i would have ended up buying them all . my husband also scored two pairs of jeans , two cotton shirts , and three pairs of boxers for under . i can see myself making the minute drive down here at least four times a year to see what new stuff comes in . my dress collection is going to get larger this year , i can tell you that . also , if you sign up online for the factory store you can get coupons for extra off your total purchase . so your super discounted items just got even more discounted .

0,"definitely a place where the reputation precedes the actual experience . it s like it s trying to be binkley s , and it s not even in the same ballpark . we were there on a thu night , and the place was dead . still , it seemed to take minutes between courses . which is fine , if you have some bread or amuse bouche between . which you don t at posh . so , you eat your tasting portion in minutes , then you sit there for another . by the time the rd course came of our th course meal at hour one and a half , we were all tired , bored , and no longer hungry . we ended up asking our last course to be wrapped , as we were that turned off . what really disturbed me on the food , however , was the foie gras . an extra supplement which is fine , as i think it s always worth it for great foie gras . we were presented a plate with nice size piece of foie gras , in a fruit coulis , and what looked like a nice brulee crust on one side . it looked amazing . and was , if i stopped at eye appeal . unfortunately , chef decided to go way off the grid , and serve it cold . i m not talking room temp , i m talking refrigerator cold . if you are a foie gras fan , then you know this is like eating a square of lard . it was impalitable . imagine being served a lump of shortening on a plate , because this is what cold foie gras tastes like . i like the surprise aspect of the courses , and i like the fact you can tell them what you like and don t like to start , but ultimately , i see now why it s best to know exactly what you re getting in advance . it took me about minutes to figure out why the whole concept of posh fails . the dining experience starts when you re wowed by a menu , and sit in anticipation of what you ve ordered . when you have no expectations , it s hard to get excited . by the time the plate is dropped and the server is telling you how your fluke is in a mascerated lima bean sauce with a marigold flower garnish and buttermilk glaze , you re not really into the ingredients , and just want to eat . i had to ask my server to repeat every course i was served at least twice lol . perhaps if i hadn t been spoiled by binkley s , that has an expansive menu that changes daily , and you pick from courses but you are given about amuse bouche and bread which is served french style with choices between courses , i suppose i would have been more impressed with posh . but not by much . . .

0,"i m gonna have to hide this review from my girlfriend who is from wisconsin and a big brewer fan . to be honest , this is my least favorite stadium to go to because of its location and just overall mediocre atmosphere . it has an outfield grass area , but it is kinda boring . maryvale is a no frills ballpark , so if you are going to a spring training game to actually watch some baseball , this is the stadium for you . if you want to go for the game , the scene and overall experience , i d recommend a stadium in scottsdale . for what it s worth , a friend of mine says this is his favorite spring training stadium , but frankly i think he feels that way since it was the one stadium he actually played in while in college . i personally like to go to a game and then head over to some bars or restaurants , but at this stadium i check out the game and then get the hell outta there !

1,"in the world of mongolian bbq near my work , there are contenders stir fry paradise and aj s mongolian formerly and possibly partially still yc s . . . . i prefer stir fry paradise because it has never been incredibly packed , and their meat resembles meat and not frozen tubes of meat shavings . the small bonus buffet offers more food if you aren t crippled by all the food you crammed into your bowl . i like the cream cheese wonton triangles , they rock the body that rocks the party . yeah , they are a little pricier if you tack on a soda . just drink water and then tweet to the world how progressive and off the grid you are by not being a soda drinker . i haven t quite gotten my sauce mix down yet , but that will come in time . that s the beauty of these places , if your food is bland then the only person you have to blame is yourself and your lack of sauce mixing artistry .

1,"probably like many recent college graduates who enjoys the drink , one of my life goals it to eventually open up a microbrewery . i tend to shy away from the idea of a brewpub since i believe that an establishment should place focus on either its beer or the food . places that do both tend to have mediocre beer and food or excellent beer but bad food . four peaks somehow passes the test on both their food and the beer . first off , parking sucks and the place gets busy . i went on a wednesday evening and it was packed . but with happy hour , what do you expect ? three dollar pints allowed me to try a bunch of their beers . my favorites included kilt lifter , hop knot ipa and the raj ipa . they even held a delicious cask ale , style of holding beer that thankfully seems to be making its way into breweries and bars . the food included fairly typical brewpub fare . burgers , wings , sandwiches etc . all of our items were of fairly decent quality . or perhaps i was a bit too drunk to really notice the awful nature of the food . but fuck it , that beer was good . hands down the best brews i ve had at a brewpub .

1,one thing i like about this place . . . are the cacti ! there are just everywhere ! this is a great place to go camping in and to take lots of pictures of the scenery . the random people here are all very friendly and so are the staff from the visitor center . the place definitely looks different when you compare from summer and winter . 
0,"the food . . . delicious . the atmosphere . . . relaxing . the service . . . pretty spot on . the pricing . . . ehhh , not my thing here . the only way i was able to eat here was because a family friend treated my family out . but if you re looking to spoil yourself or anyone you know , with food , this is the place to do it . i ordered the chicken romano pan seared with a blend of romano cheese panko breadcrumbs , with lemon shallot butter , tomatoes , asparagus yukon gold mashed potatoes . the chicken pan seared with bread crumbs was great to eat , crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside . the asparagus . . . i ve had better , but the yukon gold mashed potatoes were silky , buttery and made perfectly . they went well with the chicken romano . my dad ordered the ny strip , and they were kind of enough to cut it up for him since he was handicapped . they checked up on us frequently . the only thing i would complain about was they actually came up and asked if i was done already grabbing at my plate when the fork was still in my mouth because apparently i was still eating . since that ruined my entire experience thus far , i just told them to take it . in addition , the entire table got an order of the unlimited salad bar . the salad bar was great , but nothing like the choices offered at souplantation . also , because i ate the salad beforehand , i wasn t able to finish off the main entree i ordered . will i be back ? probably not .

1,"i don t know what it is about tempe sales , but how can you not love them ? it is primarily a fabric store , and they may or may not have all kinds of other random stuff , like carved wooden chairs , stone tabletops , bamboo flooring sadly no longer in stock , slate tiles , and so on . however , i would say that it s not merely the random selection of home decorating supplies and upholstery tools materials that makes tempe sales great . it s the family run vibe that you get from them . on one trip , to pick up several cases of flooring material , i had to go with the owner alan to his warehouse down the street . in light of buying as much as i did and helping pull it from the warehouse , he threw in plenty of sublayment material for free otherwise on closeout . the staff many of whom are part of the family have also helped me reupholster furniture and work on plenty of other odd jobs . there is no shame in being an amateur at tempe sales , even though it is primarily geared toward professionals . if you re in the market for fabric , please do yourself a favor and check it out . i bet that you will return soon thereafter just to browse around some more . the only downsides that come to mind also make the experience more interesting stock levels are not always reliable and parts of the store have historically been disorganized much better now than in the past , but my experience may be skewed since i gravitate toward closeout deals .

1,"i recently visited olive and ivy for business last week , and after visits , i am convinced that fox restaurants has some of the best establishments in the valley . olive and ivy is the fox restaurant of choice for consistently good food , great drinks , and most of all , outstanding service . i spend a lot of time in various restaurants across the valley and am always amazed at how bad service can be at some of the more popular valley restaurants . not olive and ivy . from the first phone call for reservations , to the greeting upon walking in the door to the smiles and warm reception you receive from every server you cross , this restaurant knows how to make you feel special . many of the reviews here will focus on the food and i could spend hours talking about my experiences but i will sum it up in a couple of my favorites . i hate dates and prunes , but the bacon wrapped dates are crazy good ! the shrimp and risotto main course is one of the best dishes i have tasted since arriving in phoenix years ago . and hands down , their short rib entree is best in the valley . the only catch is the cost . olive and ivy is not cheap and definitely not for brothers looking to execute the cheap date . with wine , apps , and main course , you will easy break the century mark , and if you are really being generous , is obtainable . but , it s worth every dollar and who knows , you may even get breakfast out of the deal !

0,"i decided to try qwest as i was tired of cox continually raising their rates . bad call ! cox may cost a little more but is completely worth it . if i wasn t locked in to a bs contract i would switch back right now . internet i signed up for their heavy duty internet mbps . i regularly test less than mbps on dslreports . com . the best i have ever seen is a little over . when i call to try and get it fixed they tell me there is no guarantee on speeds . that is why they advertise up to mbps . . . phone extremely poor sound quality , very loud static and crackling , shocking as this is what they should be good at . i called to complain they explained we would have to pay to have technician look at it . this was the day after install ! ! helpful hint , call back and tell them you want to cancel your account . the customer loyalty group is actually decent , they sent out a tech free of charge . he fixed it after a couple of hours , but acted completely put out that we wanted a clear line . . . the bundle ah my favorite part and what has finally pushed me over the edge to submit a review . . . i went with a bundled package phone , cable , internet . the plan i signed up for was a month . the first bill was , the second bill in i m at . . i can t make any sense out of the bill so i m not sure why they think i owe this much . i love the fact that i will get the pleasure of wasting another hour plus of my day tomorrow talking to these fools . the day this contract is up i m going back to cox and i ll be happy to pay more ! !

1,"my profile says . . . . my last meal on earth chicken and waffles lo lo s is the reason why . everytime i visit arizona , i make sure i hit this spot up . i usually order the lo lo s meal which comes with pieces of fried chicken , with waffles and a scoop of butter with syrup . yum ! this meal would not be complete without ordering their super delicious sweet tea which is served in a glass jar . there are two locations , one in lower phoenix , and the other in scottsdale . the one in lower phoenix is the original location . however , it s much smaller so wait times could vary . the scottsdale location is much bigger , so dealing with long wait times should not be as big of a problem . winner winner chicken dinner , lunch and breakfast please .

0,"i judge a soul food place by its fried chicken , a donut shop by its old fashioned , an ice cream place by its vanilla , and a greek place by it s gyros . the gyros here are bland and wholly unspectacular and sourced from the same frozen food purveyor sysco ? as every other gyro stop in phoenix . the cloyingly thick pita didn t help either . i don t know why it is so challenging to find a legitimate rotating spit gyro in this town but it is . especially near downtown phoenix . recommendations welcome .

0,"yelpers prove to be right yet again with the average stars on this one . . . i was craving sushi and had a hot date with my sister in law last night to do dinner and a movie . . . it just so happened that eat pray love was playing at the tempe marketplace harkins theater , so we decided to meet at kabuki before the movie . i walked in first and asked how long the wait was for two . . . i as told or minutes . not so bad . . . so i decided to wait . i walked outside and met up with my alexa and we came back in about ten minutes later . . . as we did so , two other women came in and i saw that they were seated right away . i looked at alexa , looked up at the hostess stand , was thinking wtf , and then went and asked nicely where we were on the list . there are two tables before you , i was told . it will likely be another ten minutes or so . at that , i responded , is there another option , perhaps sushi bar , that i don t know about ? and alas , there sure was . . . they neglected to give me that option when i originally checked in . we were seated at the sushi bar at that moment and went on to have a very underwhelming meal . here s why while the large portion cucumber salads we ordered were extremely tasty , the cucumbers were cut lengthwise in such a way that it was difficult to eat . i prefer cucumbers diced in smaller pieces so they are easier to eat ! service our waiter wasn t the friendliest . . . i felt kind of rushed by him when we were there . additionally , since we were seated in the middle of the sushi bar , all of the wait staff would reach over us to pick up the sushi for their tables , which was very distracting while we were eating ! perhaps they could ve moved the sushi ready for pick up to the side of the sushi bar to avoid distracting guests in the future ? the sushi itself was good not amazing . we had a sunset roll , a lotus roll , a large roll , and an order of ikura . i didn t realize the lotus roll was going to have a ton of mayo along with the baked lobster that came on top of it . . . it was a bit on the creamy side for my liking . to top things off , when the bill came , they overcharged us . . . a simple mistake , but given our experience , it was just one more negative thing . . . and then when i pointed it out , i barely got an apology at all . with so many other restaurants to choose from in the tempe marketplace , i am not sure i ll return to kabuki . if i do , however , i will wait for a regular table !

1,"i have been coming to lux for years ever since i started graduate school here in az . what is there to say that hasn t already been said other than hands down it is my go to coffee spot in arizona . such a warm and diverse group of people , rotating artwork , the perfect study music playing in the background although it is played a bit loud , espresso roasted on site and baked goods made on site . always find an excuse to end up there for a caf au lait or a velvet if i have a sweet tooth !

1,"it was a quick trip downtown from mesa , i didnt like some of the people getting on the train but hey its public transport . my legs were also hurting from the seats on the short trip downtown i have rls and man it hurt for days after . it was great for saving gas and if i worked by one i would take it daily . this was my first time so watch where you park by the pickup locations cause i got my car towed , fine ! ! ! i would take it downtown again but park in the right spot this time .

0,"so i m torn on how to rate this place star wise because honestly , there were a few things that were stars and there were a few things that were star . so let me break it down for you . we walked in to this cool little spot on the sunday before memorial day and it was about half full . it looked like it was very groovy but i seriously had to use my phone to walk around because it was so dark . we sat at the bar and not one of the bartenders addressed us for like minutes . maybe they couldn t see us ? anyhoo the wine list is interesting and i was having a hard time choosing something . the one bartender that finally waited on us had no personality . i asked for a taste of a few things they had by the glass . they sounded very interesting but i had never heard of quite a few of them and i pride myself on knowing my wine . the first one i tried was a syrah blend that had something to do with chocolate and it was just that . . . too chocolatey . my friend ordered a glass of the justin cabernet which is always a safe bet . i then asked for the tannat they had by the glass . it was awful . it taste like it had been opened for days . i told our personality challenged bartender and he went and tattled on us to maybe the manager ? the manager then came over and was pleasant if a bit condescending at first . he said well have you ever had a tannat ? and i said actually , all the time , i know what they re about and that is no tannat he then did agree with me and said just tell me what you re looking for i told him i wanted a cabernet franc or grenache which they didn t have either by the glass . he ended up pouring me something that really was delicious . he definitely redeemed the evening because he was professional and helpful . we then ordered the flatbread with pesto and a few different cheeses and it was seriously one of the better flatbreads i ve ever had . they had two guys playing live music and they were very good . so my break down is atmosphere attitude except for the knowledgeable bartender , he gets a flatbread qpr . . . for those non winey s this is quality price ratio"
0,great place to grab some quick groceries . 
1,"i ve been a char s patron since before we were legal to be in there many years ago , previous owners . it has always been a lively place with a diverse crowd of aging black hep cats , college students , bikers , tweakers , college students , heavy middle aged white women who love black men , the ocassional tranny and hispanic couples on dates with a sprinkling of occasional stippers hookers . in other words everything you would want to make a blues bar entertaining and just seedy enough to be interesting . they are one of the only places in central phoenix with live music almost every night of the week and the cover , if any , is typically only a couple of bucks . the place is small and dark and crowded , like a blues bar in an old converted house should be . talent varies by night but anytime you go it s passable . personal favorites are lady j and bam bam and any combination thereof , which is what you usually get any way . wander in on a random monday night and and you will find music , cruising , and drinks waiting . there is a small enclosed patio up front for smoking , about spaces in their lot and street parking available on the residential street , but watch the signs and don t block driveways . you can also cross th ave , but be careful dodging cars . the neighborhood looks scarier than it is so don t be alarmed by a transient or two wandering down the street but they don t bite unless you pay extra . close to lite rail as well in case sneaker pimps want to try to cross over from central , but hopefully they won t .

1,"i ve been eating at hap s since they were in a trailer in a parking lot on th and jefferson . and for those of you who have don t hail from the south , you will find this to be extremely good bbq . i always opt for the meat combo dinner with smoked lamb and pulled pork sometimes beef brisket . served up with cornbread and mashers plus bbq sauce and mint sauce on the side . my one gripe is they don t serve corn on the cob . head over just before or after the busy lunch hour and escape the wait in line . i don t see honey bear s getting new times best of phoenix consecutive years in a row . not to say that honey bear s isn t good but i guess it depends on what kind of bbq sauce you like since the sauce makes it . hap s was also highly regarded in sunset magazine s best of the west and several other publications hung on their wall .

1,"great addition to the cityscape lineup ! this is a big place with tons of beers on tap , sweet cushy leather seats and friendly employees . so far i ve only been for happy hour , which is great because they offer deep discounts on local beers . i m definitely looking forward to sampling some of the food options . my one complaint most of the songs we heard here i ve yet to see a live band here were horribly outdated top hits that i wish i had forgotten about . clearly that s a matter of taste though looking forward to going back !

1,"it was a busy bustling little town perched atop a small hill between the mighty superstition mountains to the east and the goldfield mountains to the west . the first gold strike was made in , and it took just a little under a year before the town came to life . one rich strike after another supported the town and approximately people who lived in the district for five rich years . the town boasted saloons , a boarding house , general store , blacksmith shop , brewery , meat market and a school house . just when it looked like the town would outgrow mesa , the vein faulted , the grade of ore dropped and the town died a slow painful death . after several unsuccessful attempts to reopen the mines , the town did come to life again from on and off until .

1,"aside from the macy s on th street in ny , this one is my favorite store . they carry all my favorite designers , especially for work clothes . not to mention , the shoe department always the hottest selection of pumps . there s a tiny ukrainian woman that works in the shoe department , i love her , she is so patient with me and gives me her two cents as she keeps bringing out the shoes . i wanna meet the buyer for this store and become her his bestie . they also have a personal shopper near the women s dressing rooms . not that i d ever have the need for one but you might . the sales people are always really nice and helpful . on a side note i once met this old guy who said he brought janis joplin to this store to buy panties when she did a show here . i ve always doubted that story but it never fails that when i go to the lingerie department i tell myself i m standing where the late great janis stood . she s one of my all times .

1,"why did i wait so long to try this neighborhood hot spot ! having a father who grew up on los olivos i remained a loyal customer , that is , until last evening s change in plans lured me to the colorfully lit and lively patio of los sombreros authentic mexican cafe cantina . i am not an expert on authentic mexican cuisine nor will i pretend to know what the flavors of san miguel de allende taste like however , i am a foodie so i know good food when i eat it . we chose to sit outdoor and enjoy the beautiful weather while taking in another cardinal s loss ! sad , i know , since they were off to a great start . . . . lucky for us it was a calm monday night and we had the full attention of our waiter , aka the bartender . phil no need to blush if you read this did a wonderful job walking us through their many margarita selections while also conveying his personal favorites that showcased his love for whiskey ! my friend allowed phil to make his margarita as he felt a fine margarita should be made while i allowed phil to concoct my special margarita while following strict no sugar , no salt , heavy on the tequila preferences . . . and that was just to start ! perfectly crafted margaritas in hand , check . now what to eat for dinner . my friend ordered his beloved mole poblano . while i couldn t decide between the smoked chicken enchiladas with salsa verde and chipotle crema yumm and the pollo a la parilla with spinach in a chipotle cream sauce or tinga poblana sauce . . i opted for the pollo a la parilla with chipotle cream preparation and , once again , my dinner friend had order envy ! ! that s not to say his mole was par or dare i say sub par because it wasn t it actually has received many culinary awards being named best mole both locally and nationally , but because the chipotle cream sauce combined with spinach , perfectly saut ed chicken breasts and a side of warm corn tortilla is . . . . amazzzzzzing ! ! ! ! it s also fair that i note aside from the pricier entree dishes served w two sides as we ordered , they also offer up tacos at . , various quesadillas . and other lesser priced authentic eats including fresh guacamole , salads and more ! deciding i d save room to see if they could satisfy my sweet tooth i boxed my remaining dinner as we read through each and every dessert . undecided , again , and so we trusted our gastronomy guide , phil , to choose . he selected the mexican chocolate cream pie to finish off the evening , and we happily finished off this delectable treat leaving one bite as i always like to do ! ! ! thank you , phil and los sombreros , for the memorable dining experience . the food was outstanding , margaritas made by phil are the best , and the patio alone is enough to draw me back for hh or even a late night dessert . thank you for staying in the neighborhood , azucena tovar , and congrats on almost turning years old .

1,"finally another downtown lunch option . i m viewing this as the in between place , in between arrogant butcher s heavy on the lawyer , heavy on the political scene diners , and in between celtic hooters , i mean , tilted kilt upstairs . the food menu is interesting , a lot of appetizers . not enough salads for my taste . compared to arrogant butcher and likely tilted kilt , the menu has less salads and less fried foods , but it ll be hard to find something healthy to eat . it veers towards the comfort food side , with options like chili with cornbread souffle , and flatbreads served with burrata fondue . there are a few flat bread options on the menu which is their version of pizza . the day i went , the lunch room was busy . you enter in through the a lobby shared with stand up live . didn t get a chance to try out their amazing beer selection , will have to try that out the next time i m here for a show . the management and service is very friendly . not in a scary way , just in a i really want to enjoy your experience way . this is in sharp contrast to the service at lucky strike across the way which i ve found to be downright rude at times . keeping my fingers crossed that they continue to do well .

1,"i brought dd and her friend here today after a long day of summer camp and running around . we showed up shortly before p . m . for their pop in playtime , which is supposed to be from am to pm . there are two rooms of bouncy house contraptions that are appropriate for children older than age . i don t know if they have actual age or size restrictions , but kids younger and or small kids would have a difficult time here . one reason it would be hard for younger kids ? there are specific instructions for the contraptions which they go over with the kids before they are allowed inside . some have a max of kids at a time the obstacle courses , some have a max of . one has a max of four , with three on the ladder and one going down the slide . younger kids would likely need to be constantly reminded of the rules , as they can be a little rigid . both my year old and the year old loved it here . they both said they preferred it to jumpstreet . the girls were bummed out when at ten minutes to someone came in and said playtime would be ending in ten minutes . then the guy said if parents wanted to know why , we could approach him . upon approaching him , he said that two birthday parties were booked for p . m . , so they were ending pop in playtime early . some parents were very upset , having just gotten there less than minutes prior . dd was very disappointed . it took a little prodding to get her to put her shoes back on and get ready to leave after only an hour of playing . on the way out , some parents stopped by and talked to the shift manager . she just handed out cards for another session since ours was cut short . pretty cool we will use the cards to bring another neighborhood kid back with us . there were just the right amount of kids here at this time of the day . i cannot imagine how nuts it must be here on a weekend or during summer mornings . still , bring a book and some bottled water and sit on the sidelines . . . or do as i did and run the obstacle course several times on the insistence of the kids . it was fun !
