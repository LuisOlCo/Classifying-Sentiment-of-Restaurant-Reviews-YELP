1,best steak i have ever eaten is at ruth s chris steakhouse . comes to your table sizzling hot . sides are sold individually but are pretty good . the deserts and appetizers are awesome . being an upscale place be prepared to take a hit in the wallet . if you really want to impress a date this would be a good place to do it . 
1,being from out of town each time i visit surprise portofino is a must stop . the decor could use some sprucing up but over all it s neat and clean . the service is excellent . the staff is very attentive . always willing to bring you another plate of wonderful bruschetta and it s free ! . if you go an a weekend in the evening you get to hear the sounds of buddy raymond . his tunes add to the ambiance . he is very entertaining . my family has actually become fans of buddy and look forward to his oldies . we only visit portofino on nights that he will be in attendance . i had the pleasure of visiting portofino last weekend and can t wait till the next time ! 
1,"as a travel consultant for cre adventures . com , we came away impressed . this is a moderately priced getaway of unquestionable value . for travelers seeking style in an in town locale , this chic desert retreat may currently fall behind the mondrian , but it easily surpasses chaparral suites next door . the staff is showing off its kimpton training , and the service standards were very welcome . this hotel gets high marks on all fronts . taggia , the hotel s new restaurant , is a stylish italian venue with a unique ligurian anchored menu that features fresh seafood and creative traditionally inspired dishes . a large kiva style fireplace warms the alfresco section , and waterfalls surround it . the only downside is that kimpton hasn t fully finished up on the room makeovers yet . compared with kimpton s usual attention to room furnishings and design , these digs are mild mannered . the older patterned carpeting was disappointing . still kimpton has done an admirable and feverish job at making over this property . kudos .

0,"bleh ! i ve heard good things about this place from my sister s friends notice , i didn t say my friends and i ve always been curious . errand days are kinda ho hum anyway , so i was excited to finally check this place out . the reason i order a doughnut that is stripped off glaze and topping is that i d like to taste the actual product . two doughnuts for my little guy and me for . . as the girl handed me the paper bag i was extra careful handling it for nothing . cold doughnuts ? am i just so used to piping hot beignets ? right off the first bite , i could feel the cheap hydrogenated oils coating the roof of my mouth . then the second bite , the feeling is now in my throat . eeek ! i asked my son what he thought . it s okay , he stared at the doughnut and looked up at me . i grab his doughnut and along with mine threw both in the paper bag it came with and chucked it . honestly , it would have been better to fry these sinful things in lard . there is something about chemically laden food that i despise most ! would i give it a second chance ? not until they change their frying oil ! sorry , bosa . one star is for the nice service and the other star is for being a local chain .

1,"food is great . best thai in west valley . always get takeout so not sure about the service , but takeout is always ready when they say it will be ready . the atmosphere is quiet and cozy about a dozen to fifteen tables or so . place always seems clean when i pick my food up and has the type of decor you d expect to see in a thai restaurant . i usually get red chicken or beef curry hot , and my wife gets green curry mild . the food is excellent . their egg rolls aren t very greasy like most places . spring rolls are also made fresh to order with fresh veggies . the only thing is , sometimes the spiciness of the curry will be spicier some days and not as spicy others . other than that , this place is great .

1,"after weeks of anticipation , side bar has finally opened . as you ascend the staircase to the second level , the reason for the long wait becomes apparent . the attention to detail is amazing . once layered with crumbling plaster , the walls were meticulously stripped to reveal the historic brickwork . other historic elements include the original steel casement windows that feature a view of downtown phoenix and the surrounding area . tastefully integrated with these elements is a contemporary interior design . the lighting consists of warm colors that set the stage for the laid back atmosphere . no expense was spared when designing the bar and tables , which are made of dark exotic woods . seating included organically shaped bar stools that adjust to a comfortable height and depth . there are also several u shaped sofas that create conversational areas . behind the bar you ll see an array of artistically arranged circular openings backlit in a warm , yellow tone . thick glass shelving lines the back wall along with a fine assortment of liquors . the soft opening menu included wines and locally brewed beers among others . i tried a white russian and my wife had a glass of chardonnay . both were very good . prices seemed to be close to average for the area and when compared to the experience , were a good value . i had a chance to speak to one of the owners who was glowing with excitement . after two years of remodeling and working with the city and adjacent historic neighborhood , his vision has become reality . in addition to a brief history of his endeavor , the owner informed me that additional overflow parking will be available adjacent to the main parking lot . parking was one concern originally voiced by the neighborhood and city . the owners may also experiment with weekly art showings by local artists . maybe they can arrange for it to coincide with first fridays . within walking distance of side bar , dining includes pei wei , my florist , and zoe s kitchen . if you re looking for a unique hangout in an urban setting , then side bar comes highly recommended . "
1,"clean establishment . rows of freezers in the back . hidden from the street . greeted by name what must be one of the regulars . carries both modelo and dos equis . slowly made food for being dead . the green enchilada sauce is a must . green chile chimis are fantastic . for the price , it was certainly filling and enjoyable . a place to come back to if you re craving decent mexican in a sit down environment but are too far away from a blue burrito grille . "
0,"we tried this place after reading most of the reviews . i had rice noodle soup w fishballs , squid , shrimp veggies and hubby had shredded pork sandwich . both were good and plenty of food . the pork sandwich was so cheap , it was hard to believe it wasn t a typo . beats a subway anyday ! the neighborhood is a bit shady but if you don t mind that , it is fine . service was quick and we will definitely revisit this place . people kept pouring in during the dinner hours . can t beat the price !

1,best cheese steaks since the last time i was in philly . highly recommended
1,"having recently moved from the bay area , i had ignorantly thought that there wouldn t be any decent ethnic , especially asian ethnic , food . thankfully , i am completely wrong ! elephant thai is a good thai place with a varied menu , freshly made food , and nice atmosphere . an added plus to the tempe location was that they allowed us to bring our small pooch to the patio area where we dined . we did have the corn cakes , which were ok . i don t remember them being bad or great . . . but my husband likes corn a lot , and i think he enjoyed them more than me . the green papaya salad was as close in flavor to the papaya salad we had freshly made for us on the beaches of thailand as i d expect around here . we also had the thom ka soup which was really tasty . it was a while ago , so i can t remember the entrees we got . i probably got the pad thai . . . just to try it , and some kind of meat dish . i definitely don t remember anything being awful . . . and although it might not have been exceptional food , it was enjoyable . thai ice tea was yummy , and my husband had the limeade which was too tart for me , although he thought it was really sweet and quite good . i do remember that for people , what we ordered was a huge amount of food that we had no chance of finishing , and yet the final bill was quite reasonable . we weren t able to order any dessert , but i did notice that they had the sticky rice w mango on the menu . it probably wasn t in season anyways , but i will definitely be ordering that at some point . this will definitely be one of our go to thai places . "
0,"i just don t think i m much of a brewery gal . granted , the beer here blows four peaks out of the water , but i d much rather have a nice cocktail than chew though a specialty brew . but if beer is your poison of choice , they ve got just about everything . the happy hour is kind of weak here though , with like a buck off all drafts . thoroughly meh . you can peruse the coolers and grab a cold one or choose from drafts they have on the menu . no bud light here though . sorry frat chumps . they used to have a ton of wine here as well like , ages ago but it has since been narrowed down to just four choices , none of which were calling my name this last go round . their orange blossom wheat beer was a bit like drinking an orange creamsicle in beer form . almost like a cider with floral notes , a light finish and a super creamy mouthfeel . oh yeah , bitches . i just went there . the perfect beer for the novice drinker to enjoy . their ipa was also pretty decent , but was more bitter than i care for , although it stayed far away from feeling like i was drinking a bottle of grassy perfume . solid . i thought they had deals on happy hour food again , like a buck off but last time i went it was no dice . at least the food s reasonably priced . tasty rueben , craptastic hummus , crispy quesadilla . the acoustics in this place are kind of shitty , so go on an off time when it won t be packed , or run the risk of smiling and nodding amicably while hearing every other snippet of convo . the high top tables are also really uncomfortable for shorties like me to sit at , but c est la vie . my biggest peeve about this place is the gigando assy television against the wall . for a place this small , a big ass mofo tv is just not the way to go . "
0,"i live close but will stop eating there . the service was slow , my friend complanned about a order he had and they said ow next time tell them to make it different for you ? really then i ordered another simple california roll took forever . the sushi is allright but the overall experience is worth driving somewhere else you lost me . . . "
1,"had myself a new york striploin and it was quite good although i do hate paying these kind of prices for steak . i really thought the vegetables were more special than the steak , but if you compare what kind of quality steak you get here compared to say donovan s high quality steakhouse in ca , i ve got to say that i like the overall package presented at keg steakhouse with respect to the quality and price . "
1,"as a vegetarian and sporadic health nut , i just love tj s . they have a nice array of inexpensive fresh produce , including my beloved broccolini , for of what safeway charges . huge selection of frozen veggie friendly dinners , good for my on the go household . greek yogurt , cheap . nice beer selection with lots of cheapo wine . i try to buy all my supplements here too , as they seem to be a lot less expensive . yes , i m all about saving cash on groceries and whatnot . the downside ? it s not one stop shopping a trip always requires supplementation with another trip to a regular grocery store . this particular tj s is teeny tiny small , and always chock full of obnoxious and or oblivious people who wield carts like weapons . my favorite is the woman who thinks it s an awesome time to teach little jimmy how to push his own wee cart and comparison shop , and lets the little bastard cruise all over the store willy nilly . i m all for giving your kid responsibility , but a you still have to , you know , keep an eye on the kid and b a super crowded claustrophobic nightmare like this place after work is not , repeat , not the time to do so . "
1,"as far as indie record stores , this is truly as good as it gets in the valley . it is a breath of fresh air because it is a real record store , and you can sample cd s along the wall to get your music fix . i love how they have a list of recommended new releases . i definitely refer to them if my music is getting stale . recently , my husband and i have bought albums from beirut , andrew bird and iron wine . they have everything your heart desires so go and get you some ! oh and i just found out you can buy concert tickets there , and they usually give out a free magnet magazine with each purchase . woohoo ! "
0,"stopped in for some macaroons and coffee , the food and coffee were decent . the place itself was kinda dirty , stains on the floor , saw a couple of flies , and sat in an uneven chair . "
0,"this is a quick grab some decent food kind of place . . this is not by any stretch the place to go for thai it s best for lunch specials . . . expensive ish for dinner for what it is . it s fine . we go for lunch because they are amazingly fast insert premade everything , but when we get tired of the same ol same ol we head to thai hut . we have had some instances of meals being too hot spicy for our table , so be sure you mean spicy when you order a spicy dish . "
0,"this place is so cool ! the menus are on the walls in sharpie along with signatures from a lot of local athletes . they will not present a bill to you , but rather trust you to tell them what you ordered and pay the correct amount . the food is great , artery clogging , and comes in huge portions . i like the smothered chicken with yams and green beans , and order it every time . i always want to sleep off the rest of the day too . saturday they do a great rib plate . good spot for those working or living in the city . "
0,"luci s is a good neighborhood spot to buy your health foods , drop in for a coffee or fresh made baked good , or pick up some beer or frozen meat on the way home . i agree with pamela s sentiment about it being a marriage of tj s and hi health with aj s prices . i ve had a couple of bad cups of coffee here , but in the times i ve been they have always been very nice and have remedied any problem very quickly . if it wasn t on my route , i may not stop here much though . trader joe s and hi health are right next door to each other at camelback and you can save a ton of money if you do it that way ! "
0,"my husband and i heard great reviews about this restaurant and we decided to give them a shot . one word can describe this place gross ! ! ! the food sounded great but then you took a bite and ewww disappointment . the salsa was lame , the chips stale . there were only two good things about this place the soda and the waitress was nice . other than that don t waste your money go to abuelo s . . . it may be on the west side but it never disappoints .

1,"my wife and i went to harris dental for a few years when we lived in scottsdale . we moved out of town in but we have never forgotten the superb dental care that we received from dr . joe harris who had come highly recommended from our austin , tx dentist as a person who keeps up wth dental research . nor have we forgotten the fabulous and uniformly cheerful staff . so it wasn t really too surprising that we received a call from harris dental a few days ago more than three years after we moved away asking for permission to archive our dental x rays and asking where they might send funds from a credit to our account . who does that ?

1,great salads and burgers ! 
0,"qver priced , substandard food . never met a cheeseburger i didn t like until now , not a lb . . small portions of tired , room temperature fry pieces , burnt bacon , chicken tenders so hard , they couldn t be penetrated with a fork . mediocre service didn t bring kids meal cookie . waste of ! "
1,i was really surprised by this place ! soooo much better than that other bertos place ! i went thru the drive thru so i m not sure about the inside but i ordered the taco and cheese enchilada combo with rice and beans . i also ordered a side of chips . the food was very good and the rice was really good ! the chips were hot ! ! loved it ! yum ! i will be back when i m in the area again . 
0,"this place sucks ! ! i moved to the valley and have yet to find that go to chinese spot , sooo i decided to give this spot a try . i called my order in and was assured by the employee that all the food is cooked to order , always fresh . so i picked up my food , and what do you know , i got some old azz fried rice with some microwaved shrimp . wtf ? ? ! ! i give this place thumbs down and i would not eat here if i was hungry as a hostage "
1," stars . girl s choice last night . . . . and we my sister , my niece carol , and myself ended up at the famous dave s in chandler . these famous dave s look like every other one . . . typically bright orange and yellow ! at night , you must have deficient eyesight if you can t find a famous dave s ! in the evening , famous dave s is just a lighthouse beacon in the middle of a drab mall ! on the menu . . . blue margarita made with blue curacao it s disconcerting when the last time you saw your niece she was just drinking cokes . . . now it s blue margaritas . must be getting old . in summary . . . not very toxic . could have drank this in one gulp and wouldn t have had an effect ! machine mixed and made . looked cool , though , with an aquamarine blue color . all american bbq feast gimmick is that all this stuff full slab of st louis style spareribs , whole bbq chicken , lb of texas beef brisket , famous fries , baked potatoes with all the fixin s replaced the coleslaw and wilbur beans , corn on the cob , muffin style corn bread is served on a bright , shiny , galvanized garbage can lid . some of the items definitely lacking in bbq flavor . hot fudge kahlua brownie warm , walnut covered chocolate brownie , soaked with kahlua liquer and topped with vanilla bean ice cream , hot fudge , and loads and loads of whipped cream . ice cream and kahlua was no where to be found ! total tab . . not bad for the amount of food . service this is a total generalization . . . but what the heck ! the wait staff at famous dave s is totally opposite from the previous evening s robotic lifeless performance from the wait staff at olive garden http www . yelp . com biz olive garden italian restaurant chandler hrid l hajh untb ezmtj ccg . i really don t give a darn if it s just a performance . . . the attitude that the wait staff presents will be passed onto the customers . . . whether bad or good . typical of all famous dave s you sit at a booth or table covered with red and white checkered table cloths . at the front entrance is a display of all the bbq awards that famous dave s bbq items have won . . . . mostly in the midwest . check out the lead pipe utilitarian interior design . . . cool ! very colorful and festive atmosphere ! kids or adults with a kid s attitude will love famous dave s .

1,"have only been here once before under too stressful of circumstances to remember , this trip to olive and ivy was fantastic . usually going to lunch in scottsdale is hit or miss with expectations , however today we had a lunch meeting scheduled for , i got a front row parking spot in front of the valet and had no problem being seated right away . sticking to my lunch salad trend , i ordered the curry salad with chicken and couldn t have asked for a more perfect dish on such a warm day . the portions were great , the lettuce cool and crisp and even the handmade bread and pesto before complimented everything perfectly . the only gripe i would have , understanding it is a fox restaurant , was how almost unnatural the wait staff was with how rehearsed and methodical all interactions were . even down to the correct usage of i am well versus i am good seemed a bit out of place , but not a big deal .

0,"honestly , i love cupcakes . like i said in my wicked bakery review , eating a cupcake , unlike a slice of cake , gives one a sense of accomplishment . i like cupcakes . i like the sense of accomplishment you get from eating a cupcake . you may have had a hard day , but you finished an entire cupcake . that s validation . it makes me happy . sprinkles is a great place to go for a sugar fix , but i have to say there are some negatives . i have had a dry cupcake there . they are a bit on the expensive side . the worst sin of all ? their red velvet is a southern style light chocolate cake with a cream cheese frosting . i have to disagree . i don t detect any cream cheese flavor in that frosting . the first time i devoured a sprinkles cupcake it was magical . i was particularly impressed with the black and white belgian dark chocolate with creamy vanilla frosting . i was in a shoebox los angeles apartment and the cupcakes seemed of adequate size . the next time was the new location am currently reviewing and they were consumed in a larger than shoebox chandler house . they seemed a little small . the third time was in my car a subaru baja , and the cupcakes , again seemed sizable . i d have to think that consuming a sprinkles cupcake in an suv would not be a great idea the cupcake to eating space ratio would be all off . for true cupcake validation , i ll drive the . miles to wicked . ok you caught me . i might stop by for an emergency fix if i happen to be in the area , but i ll be thinking of slade at wicked . . . and i ll be consuming my confection in a small space .

0,"this is a pretty chill spot for drinks bar food . we went on a sunday night after a big meeting that was held at the phoenix convention center . they were able to accommodate a group of about of us without any issues not a whole lot of people there . their quesadillas and curly fries are quite good and i could not help reaching for the nachos again and again , but definitely avoid their caesar salad i know , who orders salad at a bar anyway ? ! "
1,"i went to tuck last night because of the reviews on here , and i loved it . it really is tucked away and all the better . it feels even more special . we had the panini bites , dates stuffed with chorizo , and the citrus brined fried chicken with white cheddar waffles . not your greasy comfort food here . everything was delicious and i can t wait to go back and try more .

1,amazing food . great date night place with an impressive wine list . definitely come her again and more often . 
0,"i have to say i was pretty disappointed with our brunch experience here . ok class , let s have a lesson . what makes a good , traditional , eggs benedict ? easy question , you say ? answer nice crispy , toasted english muffin , meat of your choosing let s go with canadian bacon , creamy delicious hollandaise . what am i missing , class ? ah yes , a beautiful poached egg , which bursts when pierced , spilling it s silky , golden yolk . ok so now that we ve had our lesson , let s put it into practice . my eggs benedict was served with three quartered tomatoes , very very very crunchy potatoes with no seasoning and two eggs benedict . one was completely missing a yolk ! bummer . when our server came over , i told him and he brought out a new one , but the yolk was overcooked . bummer , times two . my friend also had an overcooked egg on his plate . for the prices they re charging , we should have had four perfectly cooked eggs and well seasoned potatoes . it s brunch , not brain surgery . the space is beautiful , and the server was pleasant , but i won t come back . too many other places to try for brunch .

1,"being a san jose native , i know pho and vietnamese cuisine . let me tell you , khai hoan is excellent . definitely the best i have had in az and comparable to the best noodle houses in san jose . the pho rice noodle soup is great beef or chicken . the dry noodles and rice dishes are generous portions , and very tasty . great ingredients in everything . make sure you get an order of spring rolls . . . if you have not had vietnamese food , check it out ! it is fantastic . if you have had vietnamese , go to khai hoan and you will not be disappointed .

0,"service stars which is so rare . food . stars . my husband and i are a little picky when it comes to steaks we eat morton s and mastro s but we wanted to try a new steakplace while visiting phoenix and durant s had great reviews . when you get to the restaurant , you walk through the kitchen pretty cool to see everything then you re greeted by the host . we came for a pretty early dinner and literally every single person host , kitchen staff , waiter waitresses greeted us . the decor is pretty cool kind of burlesque ish , all walls are a deep red , there are huge vases of roses everywhere . our waiter fred was awesome ! ! very friendly and professional . i had their vegetable beef soup good but salty and my husband had house salad . i ordered the trout with lemon caper sauce which was very bland . my husband had rib eye and it was also bland which was surprising . their dessert trio creme brulee was the best part of the meal ! so from this meal we decided if we want steak , we re sticking with our usual morton s .

1,"prefer this place over other clothing exchanges in the area . friendly staff . . . store is usually pretty quiet when i go in which is nice as i cannot stand crowds ! mens selection is a little skimpy . . however when i go there it s usually just to sell . on that note , they pay you more of the retail value of any of your clothing than buffalo does ! and , it s always nice to be able to support local businesses !

1,"this place makes some of the best vegan gelato ice cream i ve had . if you re vegan , skip the kinda gross soy froyo , and eat one of the gelatos . the service was super friendly and all the gelatos were super tasty . i had a big scoop of peanut butter soy gelato . it was by far the best peanut butter based ice cream i ve ever had .

1,everything i have had here has been wonderful . very fresh . the service is good . the food is wonderful . i have eaten at this one and the one in glendale . excellent food in both locations . 
0,"bar smith has potential to be a chic hot spot in the heart of downtown just a few steps away from the symphony hall , chase field , and the us airways arena . however , this place , despite it s pseudo hipness fails to deliver in the cocktail department , which , with it s continuously crappy music , would be the only real reason you d come to this bar . it s really a . star place bartenders are nice , but don t really get the job done . when you re paying over drink , you d at least expect them to do that . the roof is cool though so an extra . stars for that .

1,"this is the old rigatony s on brown rd if you ve never been , it has a buca di bepo ish , before buca was cool , sort of feel . they even serve their house chianti in a small water glass , instead of a wine goblet adding to an authentic joisey kind of feel . this is traditional italian american fare , rich and flavorful with big portions . the chicken piccata is crack good . it s served in what i ve come to learn is a sicilian style , with a n awesome relish of tomatoes , capers , and green olives and a side of addictive fett alfredo . it never gets old . another great authentic dish is their cecca you can get it as a pie pizza , that is or over pasta . you just have try it . it s rich , refreshing , and explosively flavorful all at once . the house salad is a variation on a traditional antipasto theme and is a meal , and event , in and of its self . the best thing about mardeneley s is that everything on the menu is good ! it only gets four stars because it could use a bit more snob appeal and a better beer selection .

1,"out of the three filipino restaurants in mesa i think this is the best , lots of choices in the food , and the cantelope drink is a must have . the portions are really good , and price is very reasonable . i took my friends there last week and they liked it . only thing i ask the cook though is too go a little easier on the grease , but than again it wont be a filipino dish if there weren t grease oozing out of it lol"
0,"should be called the bad egg . bottom line , the hotel s free breakfast tasted better than this and we got better service there . we arrived around am on a sunday morning and had to wait around seven minutes to be seated . the staff was pleasant enough . we were seated , given menus with water and she took our order for coffee and the breakfast special loaded potato skillet . we sat for minutes before we saw our waitress again . she finally figured out she forgot to bring our coffee . we finally got some coffee which was mediocre in flavor . our food arrived about ten minutes after that . the skillet was supposed to contain sausage , bacon , onion , scrambled eggs , grilled american potatoes covered with cheese and sour cream . mine had no bacon , two tiny chunks of sausage , no cheese , and the potatoes were so soggy , they tasted like someone had thawed them and thrown them in as an afterthought . it was so unpalatable i could not eat more than one bite , even after loading it up with salt and hot sauce . the waitress never checked on us once during the meal . she came back by the time my husband was finished . i told her the meal was horrible in a nice way . she offered me something else . by that point , i was not feeling like eating anything else , i felt kinda sick . my meal was comped and we did get an apology . the manager explained that everyone loves that special and the potatoes are seasoned and grilled . the cook obviously didn t try my potatoes . blech . even with the comp , the total was over for one special and two coffees . very hight priced for nasty food , poor service , and loud uninspiring atmosphere .

0,"i have nothing more to add , but i don t want anyone to think only a few people had complaints about this poorly planned festival . oh , wait , i do . i was there with my year old grand daughter and my daughter , since there were going to be kids attractions as well as the food trucks . i thought it was nuts that minutes of jumping around cost . but i guess it was consistent with the water and beers . and it would help if there was some roadway controls and or temporary signage . by am , traffic backed up down pima from the event to indian bend and over towards the . cars were skipping ahead and cutting into line , further delaying entrance . if success is measured by interest , the festival was a success . if by performance and customer satisfaction , not so much . and how can a vendor commit to showing and not have enough food to feed the presold ticket holders ? why risk your hard fought reputation ?

1,"my mom and my son and i went to old town on a thursday to check out some galleries and listen to some of the buskers ! so after our perusing we stopped to get ice cream . real ice cream ! petersen s is a really cool place and it s brand new ! just opened i think . well they have lots of great flavors like georgia peach , ny black cherry , cappuccino , peppermint with real peppermint , lots of sorbet , lots of chocolate stuff that i didn t want to try , and old favs like cookie dough , butter pecan etc . they also sell pints and also gallons i think ! the staff is super cool and well educated about the history of the shop . i think the girl said they originated in chicago and that the tiles in the ceiling are from the original location ! i just thought that was so cool ! she also said that they could sub the milk in your lattes and coffe with ice cream to make pepperment lattes and more wild flavors ! i thought that was pretty rad . anyway , if you are in old town i highly recomend you check this place out !

1,"i was frost bitten when the first location opened in tucson . since , i have tried numerous gelato places and none have come close to the creaminess , tastiness and overall authentic fare as frost . each dip of the spoon is reminiscent of my travels abroad in italy with memories that bring a smile to my face and pleasure to my tongue . the san tan village location is minutes away but the drive is worthwhile . the staff is friendly , helpful and armed with spoons for you to sample any flavor you wish . i went with the dark chocolate and salted caramel . truly delightful ! word on the street is there are locations to pop up around the phoenix area . i think tempe would be a great choice ! hint hint . . . .

1,it s not only a book store but also a community wherein a lot of readers meet . they also have a wide selection of used and unused books as well as novelty items so i get to do my shopping at the same time ! 
1,"when a man falls in love , it s a special thing . not because his calloused hands and heart are finally softening . not even because he has found something that completes his very living soul . it s special because he is simply , and utterly . . . . happy . ladies and gentleman of yelp . . . . i have found the pizza that makes me happy . i heard all the hype . . . best pizza in the country , oprah says it s the best , the food network hypes it up , chris bianco learned how to make pizza from jesus . ok , i made up the last one . my friend and pizza aficionado , lance has been known to drive in from los angeles . . . just for this pizza , and then he would drive home . sometimes , he d even fly in . it had to be good , right ? tonight , i chose pizzeria bianco for my birthday dinner because of the hype . i had made a pathetic attempt to dine here once , but myself and the individual i was with , we both were intimidated by the hour wait . is any pizza worth three hours ? that s a personal judgment call . that night , i ended up dining at nobuo , across the path . . . . and it was a nice meal . i digress . i ve been preparing for this trip . i read up on various press articles , and discovered that as of last week , they are open for lunch and mondays ! perfect . tonight , i dined with my parents . my favorite dining companions . we sat down in the very intimate dining space . no wait at all . perhaps , people don t know that they are open on mondays . fine by me . the decor is nice . simple , with a classic cucina feel . the brick oven is the star of this place . clearly . we ordered some bread to get started . it came with a little cup of high end olive oil . fantastic ! the crust was crisp , and the bread was chewy to the point where you can t help but smile when you eat this . the pizza is phenomenal . we ordered two pizzas for three people . one was half rosa and half margherita , the other was the biancoverde . this way we were able to try three different kinds of pizza . all three styles were phenomenal . the winner of the three was the margherita . the tomato sauce doesn t overpower , the mozzarella melts like a dream , and a hint of basil . the rosa was unique , and also delicious . the arizona pistachios take some getting used to , but pairs well with the red onion . the biancoverde was much more complex . definitely a hearty pizza because of the ricotta cheese . very tasty . it s topped with arugala , so you will get a nice earthy , and loud flavor . usually when i eat pizza , i take a bite of the crust , and then i leave the rest . not here . i went through the entire pizza slice because it s perfect . chewy , crispy , and full of happy ! take it from me . . . . this place is worth the hype . look at the reviews from other yelpers . even the picky ones love this place . maybe it s true . maybe chris bianco did learn how to make pizza from jesus . sure as hell tastes like it . now if you are wondering about the other stuff , it was also a five star experience staff friendly and attentive , and the bathrooms are spotless . worth the hour wait ? yes . bring all your friends here ? yes . will i guarantee the awesome ? yes .

0,"with a name like america s taco shop , i had to check the place out . got the homemade ceviche and the carne asada taco . thought the prices were a bit high for the quality and amount of food that i received . the ceviche and tortilla chips that came with it were a bit bland . the carne asada taco was good but not spectacular . what got me though as i sat indoors in their dining room was i started to notice how dusty everything was . there was a grimy layer of dust over all the decorations on the walls and the tops of the condiment bottles were frankly disgusting like they had not been wiped in ages . so i decided to check out their bathroom . sure enough , the ladder they had leaning against the wall had a layer of dust on them . . . . and i felt a little grossed out . . . let s just say , if the public areas like the dining area and bathroom are not clean and well care for , i don t really want to imagine the condition in the kitchen . . . "
0,"i went here because all my friends were peeing their pants about how good it is . wrong . the slow perhaps retarted staff with no customer service , alongside the barely mediocre tasting pizza both contributed to my disdain for this awful eatery . fuck it . . . stick to slices . "
1,"went there for my birthday . . . . another quality insured restaurant , it is inside of four seasons , it cannot go wrong . . . . the restaurant is very classy with a nice and upscale environment . . . . and most of all with a very nice view to the phoenix area the service is definitely top notch and food was excellence as well . had the sea bass and the filet mignon . . . . both were yummy . . . . and customized birthday desert as well . . . . will go back for a visit for sure . . . also if you are in talavera , don t forget to grab a drink in the patio as well . . . . they have live music and watching the birds flying around the mountain the resort is built into the mountain was quite a view"
1,the food wasn t phenomenal but it was very good . the service was excellent . the decor was very cool . a good experience . great selection of wines by the glass . very pleasant experience . 
0,"this place came recommended by the hotel and some colleagues in phoenix so my expectations were high . i went with the recommendation of the waiter and chose the salmon mistake . it was dried up and had zero flavor . the potatoes and asparagus that accompanied the dish however were cooked perfectly . i also had the wedge salad to start , which was more like two mini wedges . great presentation on the salad , but sort of strange with a devil s egg in the middle of the plate . good but strange and a little too small with the portion size . after all , iceberg lettuce is cheap . the waiter was attentive and staff were all nice . not sure i would ever go back . "
1,"this place is great if you are traveling with your dog ! the double bed room was extremely clean and updated . nice fluffy pillows and duvet covers . bathrooms nice and new looking . the daily breakfast bar was wonderful and the sitting area clean and nice . the one issue was the ac . jeez it was a rattle bucket and kept us up at night . we would turn it off until we would wake up sweating and then turn it on for an hour , wake up and turn it off . . . . . oh brother . i would have liked a good night sleep , since everything else was nice . pets welcome and that was a bonus .

1,"great service , great food , highly recommend . we had the scollops and they were to die for , the scotch beef and mac and cheese were also amazing . will definitely go back and recommend to friends . "
1,"this was the launch of our seven summits of phoenix mountaineering adventure . our goal is to reach all of the seven summits by the end of april and we are off to a great start . although it took us two attempts two separate visits to reach the summit , we did it with a few breaks and plenty of gasping along the way on new years day . it was our way of starting the new year on the more active side of things . this hike really gave us a great work out with the steeper parts of the path allowing for a good sweat . the trail is a continuous climb with a few resting spots and with plenty of photo ops to the summit . it does get pretty crowded and parking can be an issue on the weekends after the early hours . there are picnic tables , ramadas , restrooms and of course a stunning degreee view once you reach the summit .

0,"if we hadn t arrived after a tiring day and prepaid online , i would have checked out . furniture missing . security bar sheared off . faceplates for wiring gone . furniture handles missing . bobby pins and scraps of things on carpet hadn t been vacuumed . two remaining chairs badly stained . you wouldn t want to sit on them . no uniforms or name tags on staff . pick another chain . the reviews for the other ramada s in the area which i read after the fact reflect the same things .

0,"we visited on april th and and also sunday april . . i have twice now gone to your restaurant and twice been told that i couldnt use my bogo coupon . the first time my mother went to pick up our order , she was told we didnt order the right food and we had to order off the main entress . the second time we ordered , i was told that we had to order off of the diner select menu . i did not have my coupon handy , and when i was able to read it , it says specifically , offer valid for one complimentary diner select with the purchase of another entree . complimentary diner select must be of equal or lesser value to purchase entree . valid entrees include signature dishes , bowls , salads , diner selects and lettuce wraps . so why , on two separate occasions were we told conflicting information and not allowed to use the coupon , thus spending a small fortune on food , twice ? ! ? ! ? your customer service is far from what it used to be and i doubt you will be getting more of our business any time in the near future .

1,"this is a wonderful little find . we sat on the nd floor patio and it was the perfect fix for a busy day . we sipped wine in front of the fire and watched the sky change colors over camelback mountain . the service was fabulous . they didn t rush us and without asking , split our shared orders for us . the food was fabulous ! omg ! you have to get the walnut gorgonzola salad with the warm sweetened balsamic dressing . mmmm . i would get that again in a heartbeat . we also split a flatbread with fries and it was excellent as well . i will definitely go back .

0,"here s a thought , don t post on the door to your restaraunt up scale mexican food unless you can prove it . this was not upscale , it was barely pass able as decent . didn t help that the waitress got both of our orders wrong . will not return . "
1,"this place is a lil bit of awesomeness ! the food was great , the service was awesome , and the atmosphere was very nice ! what s not to like about a great steakhouse that serves great food and provides awesome service . "
0,"i guess this is an east coast midwest thing because i really don t get it . i m not a picky eater and i hate wasting food and money , but i could not finish my plate . i ordered french toast and i was not aware that my french toast was going to be deep fried . seriously , when i put my fork through it , a piece of fried toast hit me in the eye . my husband was also not impressed with his food . if someone would like to suggest something delicious on the menu that i should try , please let me know because i currently want to vomit every time i see a chompie s .

1,"let s see . . . . . cents at taco bell for a taco that has cheese like sprinkles on a cupcake , or a baja soft taco that has five pieces of tomato in it ? you must be joking . compare your baja soft taco to the picture sometime and feel free to yell at the counterperson . yes this happened . taco bell should be sued for complete misprepresentation ! ! meanwhile at del taco . . . . . cents for a balanced taco with a decent amount of cheese and delicious medium scorcho sauce the choice is clear . plus the deluxe tacos are chock full . i usually get regular tacos and end with deluxe ones . i ve had the double cheeseburger once , nothing impressive there . it wants to be an in n out double double , but it falls short , like when you were a kid and wanted levi s s for christmas and end up getting sears jeans . come for the cheap tacos and load up i say ! the burritos are ok too .

0,"i graduated from marinello at the end of august , and let me tell you , i was glad to get out of there . while the teachers were very knowledgeable in their trade , the program and administration is less than desirable . when i first toured the school and started classes in january , i was promised many things to learn , one of them being makeup classes . still to this day they do not have those classes available at the school , and those were pretty big reasons to why i wanted to go there . there was also a lot of drama in the midst of my schooling there . several administrators left , a teacher left , and they changed everything that we were used to . they started focusing on advertising instead of getting students product to use , and there was a lot of times when school product would go missing when they didn t go missing before the administration change . besides those things , the school is okay . at the very least , it will teach you what you need to know to be an aesthetician in the state . but i definitely wouldn t go there again , and i definitely wouldn t recommend anybody to go there . be sure to look around at other schools before you decide what s best for you .

1,"the food is excellent ! we have been times now , and everything we have had has been delicious ! we will continue to dine w bill and il bosco ! the caprese is awesome ! "
1,this place is great for a big group of people . we originally thought we were going to have people . we ended up having by the time everyone showed up . the staff was more than happy to accommodate us . the kota athenian chicken is very good . the price range is moderate . all in all a fantastic place . 
1,"i ve never been to the former restaurant that was once housed in this quaint little building , so my first impressions may be a bit different from others . i have always adored this house . it s absolutely adorable and in such a good location . i read over the weekend that the new restaurant here was opening , so we made a point to visit it sooner rather than later . we chose to go right after work , so there were only a few other people in here . i really like the setup with the bar in it s own little alcove and seating situated throughout the rest of the house . we were greeted immediately after walking in and we sat in a table by the window . while we perused the menus i couldn t help but tap my feet to the killer old school music they were rockin . i ended up deciding on the grilled cheese to eat . the food was very good . the sourdough bread was super toasty , literally grilled to perfection . there was a ton of cheese in the sandwich , but i don t remember which kinds . the important thing is that it was really tasty . my only complaint is that the cheese wasn t ooey gooey . it was melty , but i could still make out the shape of the cheese . in my book of grilled cheese greatness , it needs to be a little messier . the sandwich was also served with a side of chips or salad if you choose . the chips were good and i ate them all up . there was also a dill pickle , but i don t do dill pickles . i definitely think that this is a killer new spot that will do very well . i have no doubt that this ultra hip but non pretentious spot will quickly become a neighborhood favorite . "
1,"came here in a daze after not having slept for a loooong time and flying in to the airport with dad reminds me of the nice breakfast diners in chicago , got the combo with turkey sausage still greasy defeats the purpose , eggs always the same everywhere , french toast more white bread , nothing too special but filling , coffee . nice atmosphere and no major problems , would be great for the weekend brunch ! "
1,"my wife and i just dined at this restaurant . i am a chef and must say that chef chris s concept is one i have not experienced . the food was outstanding , service excellent and the decore was creative , down to the flower pot wine bucket and old wooden crate that it sat on . our entrees were served on either a bed of sundried ploenta or baby spincach and blackrice . what really intrigued me was the slaw made of shredded green papaya that was part of the appetizer course . being a chef i had to share a neat appetizer , that i recently found , using a baby corn shoot ! chef keep up the suberb cafe monarch bravo . "
1,"great concept ! my girls love this place . you have to really learn the schedule when the place is really busy because it gets packed and that is when the experience is diminished and the potential for getting hurt is heightened . the big plus is the multitude of things to do . for the smaller , . younger children , they have their own set of trampolines and the bounce houses . . well , who doesn t love a good bouncy bounce ! the older kids can experience the main attraction and i will tell you that watching some of the stunts is pretty amazing ! not to mention the dodge ball , foam pit and the maze . . . hours gets eaten up pretty quick . whats great about this is that kids are being active and really getting a work out . i was out for like minutes and my butt was kicked . . . so this is a great way to get your kids moving and motivated . the staff is young , but so is the staff at hot dog on stick . . . but they keep things pretty well under control and i have only seen one person get hurt in all the times that we have been there . looking for common sense , good customer service , or a straight answer and you might have better luck talking with the floor . worth the money . . . great value . . . and fun . a definite two thumbs up in my book .

1,"stopped there for breakfast . a cozy little place , with very friendly and smiling persons . their house coffee is fine , but will have to go back for a dirty chai . i had also a bagel just like any other . a nice drive through , and a good alternative to start the day ! "
0,"i went in yesterday for happy hour to have a birthday drink . i had the house margarita for . . actually i had two ! they were good . i think i disappointed the bartender when i question him why his . margarita he was pushing was supposedly so awesome . he claimed cruz a local tequila was the reason . i argued just because it s local doesn t make it good . lol . the house rita stands up alone , as a good traditional rita on the rocks . don t buy the hype , as i saw half the crowd not question it and accept the pricier one on special as the way to go . the place was busy . they were also hosting a mba networking mixer just off the main bar . in addition to discounted beer at happy hour they also offered free food ! i thought those days were gone but they kept a steady supply of warm chips , salsa , veggie tray , cold pinwheel wraps and one or two hot mexican items mini chimis , and bean cheese nachos coming . i was going to order a half price appetizer as part of my happy hour , but heck i went for the free food and was just fine . my sampling of the appetizers makes me wonder how good the menu was , so i peeked at it . it looks pretty basic but tasty . i think everything was or less on the dinner menu . according to the sign outside lunch starts at . . it may be commercialized mexican food but it s a step up from some places like taco bell and baja express for certain . the staff seemed competent and to work rather well together . even though it was busy the staff was calm and quick to serve , which is a good thing . they seem to recognize some customers as regular patrons which was also nice . the woman s room off the bar was fresh and clean in this madness as was the bar and all areas i could see . i think i will be back . i think i could even become a fan of the place over time . it seems to have a good mix of people and an impressive straight male clientele , worth another look .

1,"this is my new addiction ! took some friends and family here to celebrate my mom s birthday , it was her first time and she had a blast . our first chef poncho isn t at this location any more which we were disappointed about but ended up having another great chef named sam . he was funny and the food was great ! i tried grilled shrimp for the first time and i am a fan . our waitress was awesome ! on top of everything , funny and she told us sam was the head chef and that it was an honor to have him cook our food and that she was so glad we got him , seeing that it was the first time for almost everyone in our group to try a place like this . we have also had dinner on the patio when it was cooler out and enjoyed it too . i will be eating here often . thanks hayashi for always making my dining experience fun and delicious"
1,i have been to the freddy s location in gilbert several times and really enjoyed it so when i saw a freddy s had opened in my hood i was excited . my daughter and i went over for some dessert and they did not dissappoint ! the custard was smooth and creamy with lots of toppings to choose from . i have not tried the burgers at this location yet but if they are anything like the other location they will be very tasty . and don t forget to try the shoestring fries . i usually like thicker fries but these are nice and crispy and delicious ! i m so glad freddy s took over this location . 
1,"very excited to try this place out . i tried the sampler of all beers and really enjoyed them all however , the watermelon ale was my favorite . great service , cool , relaxed atmosphere and delicious beer a winner ! "
0,if you are going out for beer than papago brewing in the same strip mall is a much better choice . but if you are looking for a true bar with liquor and beer than the british open certainly qualifies . not a huge fan of the food with the exception of the fried pickles . typical greasy pub fare . darts and pool tables and a good juke box . service is usually pretty good every time i ve been in there . very dark and very much a neighborhood bar . 
0,"this bar reminds of an old pair of pants . it fits . not too tight , not perfect . just kind of fits . there s some holes in the knees , and its a bit faded . it s certainly not perfect . mulligans is that bar where you can go and kick it with your friends . you never know what kind of people you are going to run into . co workers , drunkards , bottle rats who got kicked out from other places . the drinks are cheap . the beer selection is so so . the bartenders are pretty nice , but aloof . it s just an average bar though . nothing great , nothing bad .

1,yum ! healthy selections and delicious flavors ! 
1,"decent menu which includes the traditional satay , tom yum koong , curries , pad thai etc . what threw me off was teriyaki , sweet and sour chicken , kung pao , chow mein . food is good with great portions ! careful on the heat scale . is blazin . . . weird thing . . . . i was really thirsty after the meal . usually that s the result of using the other type of salt . overall the place is clean , modern , and staff are attentive . curries are bones , fried rice at , and most entrees at bones ! price is a buck plus more than our so cal places . give it a try , food is good , and service is fast . damm . . i need to drink another bottle of soda ! ! ! .

1,"oooooooooh man am i so glad this place isn t near my house , i would gain pounds in no time ! my sister took me here for the first time a couple weeks ago and my mind was blown by all the unique flavors they served ! the shop itself is very cute and modern . i like that they have a section in the back with a bunch of board games , very cool . as for the ice cream i got the dutch chocolate and the horchata . the horchata was so so good , i cant stop thinking about it ! the following week i took the husband there . again the ice cream was very good but the service was terrible . it was an older lady behind the counter and she really couldn t care less that we were standing there . she let me sample an ice cream and then i just stood there for a good minutes while she did other things behind the counter . we did finally get served but my husband wasn t impressed with the serves one bit . this time i got my ice cream in a waffle cone , the cone was so light and airy , i loved it !

1,"love the four peaks . can get crowded as hell , and parking is a bit of a cluster f , but i ve never ever not had a fun night there . the beer is excellent , the service has always been attentive , and the food is above normal bar standards the fish and battered fries was very good , the tartar sauce is good , but ask for the cocktail sauce . . . it s fantastic . heavy on the horseradish enough to feel it in your nose ! and the rueben might just be the best in town . the happy hour is great . locally brewed pints ? sign me up the location and the it being an actual brewery gives it extra points . i had family in town this week , and i like to take out of towners to places that have a local az vibe . they definitely got a taste of my arizona . next time they ll have to come during pumpkin porter season"

0,"so , not following my own advice ahem , never return , i returned here for a friend s birthday dinner a few months ago i super love this person so how could i say no ? . ha ! big mistake . also , fair warning there are several a caps lock ahead . the only pleasant thing about the evening was the reservation and seating were right on time for our large group people . and of course because we were celebrating a super special person . i ll keep this update short and sweet for a can of soda ? get real . i knew it d be overpriced but i was at least expecting a mini bottle or something . but a can ? come on . you bought that in bulk and paid . cents for it . fail . your servers idiots . first it takes our server minutes to come around the first time and take drink orders . then she s back another minutes after that taking the orders again . did you forget ? were you not paying attention the first time we around ? why did it take minutes just to order drinks ? and on top of that we wait another to receive them . forty five minutes to receive drinks is bad . very , very bad . also , not taking food orders until after we ve been seated for one hour is bad . very , very bad . seated at o clock , we didn t receive our food until almost ten o clock . two hours for food is very , very bad . do you hear that , st . francis ? bad . because i loathed the place even before this lovely birthday dinner , and because the thought of supporting such an establishment makes my blood boil , i ordered only dessert and the hubs ordered an appetizer and add on a can soda . funny , that our bill was still nearly for the both of us . excluding tip . bad . also , server if you say you re not going to split a check , stick to your word or don t even try . now , i m glad you didn t stick to your stingy i don t split checks , because i could foresee the mess of trying to split a bill with people i didn t know so well . lucky for us , when we told you we were leaving early and asked for our check , you split it for us . a couple others caught on and did the same , but the remaining people were not so lucky . because i realize my short and sweet is not so short anymore or sweet , for that matter , i m ending it here . note to self heed own advice and stay away from st . francis !

1,"bianco is a great place to go for a reasonably priced dinner with good ambiance and solid rendition of mexican food . yup , there are holes in the wall tacquerias with tastier food . but bianco is spot on in terms of overall concept with good service and modern furnishing . puts this on a repeat list .

1,i went here for my birthday this year . the best part was my friends picked up the tab the food was fantastic . when i found out from a friend who works here that the same chef who created the city hall menu is the executive chef at ocean club i knew getting a steak to compliment my fish was the right choice . the only down side was that everyone who went out that night were so full that we decided that it was a better idea to go home ad sleep than hit the clubs . . . . . well maybe that wasn t a bad thing after all . 
1,high quality sushi fish . expensive . good atmosphere . good service . 
1,"what an exciting time . i am writing my first yelp review about the wonderful mojo yogurt i visited yesterday afternoon . there were so many wonderful flavors to choose from and the people there were nice enough to pass out tiny little sample cups . it was a challenge narrowing down my selections to a few flavors but i somehow managed . i ended up with birthday cake that s right , there is birthday cake flavored yogurt , life is good , cafe latte , and the divine original tart . after throwing on a few gummy bears i was a happy girl . i see in other reviews that some complained about pricing but i am willing to pay a little extra for quality and happiness .

1,"awesome job rejuvenating this bar from the dark dive bar it was . they have a great selection of brews from all over az , the us , and the globe as well as a very decent wine list . thus far i ve tried the pork tacos and the grilled cheese , both of which were delicious . service was a little on the slow side as our server was clearly over loaded .

1,i m usually not a fan of indoor tanning but post baby i felt like i needed a little pick me up color . i chose this place because of their good prices tans in a lay down bed for dollars . the staff is so amazing and friendly and i got a nice brown tint after a couple of sessions . 
1,amazing food and i prefer the atmosphere at this location . 
1,"i live in la where these shops are on every corner . i can say without a doubt , this is the best froyo i ve had ! on top of that , the store staff is super friendly and the place is immaculately clean . they are also serving gelato , pastries and fresh coffee espresso . check it out ! "
1,i found this place based on yelp reviews so i feel obligated to add one more star review to the mix . i needed to get a chain fixed on my bike and was not looking to spend a ton of money or hours trying to fix it myself . so i stopped by and had them take a look at it . they recommended a full tuneup to keep it in tip top shape and spent the time explaining and demonstrating why it is deserving of spending money beyond the chain repair . i ended up passing but didn t feel like they were trying to take advantage of me . since it was close to closing time i left the bike with them overnight and got a call late in the morning the next day for pickup . it has been as good as new ever since . having my fair share of riding in the valley of the sun i m sure i ll be back soon for some inter tubes or a spare part for whatever craigslist bike i happen to be riding around at the time . protip check out the unique bike artwork they have around the place . also they have a small bmx ? track in their backyard you can ride around and do jumps on anytime . 
0,"sometimes there s a cover , and sometimes there isn t . in true nightclub fashion , you can never really tell what it s going to be either . i ve never seen anything good happen downstairs . the music has never been good , regardless of the genre that night hip hop , techno , etc . and , the overall vibe is pretty lackluster . upstairs , however , is house music heaven . located outside under the stars , on a relatively small balcony , the vibe is always pretty stellar . open air , video collages on the walls , and awesome music . i ve never been let down yet . even on a random wednesday evening recently , when it was almost empty , the music was still amazing . if you live in the valley , you have to visit the upstairs of bar smith at least once . it s fantastic . it s a shame they ve never been able to replicate any of the upstairs magic to the rest of the club though .

0,"my friend and i have been going to camelback spa for about years for our birthdays . this past year we decided to try something new . we went to desert ridge spa for a change of pace man were we ever sorry we did . the facilites are not nearly as nice as camelback , the food service sub par at best while they did make it right the fact that my friend ordered one thing and was given another and we complained to the waitress her response , was oh i was curious at which one of you got the wrong order really ? ? you knew that and didn t come up to us ? i asked for my burger medium and it came well done , i am glad i didnt wait for her to come back and ask how my food was cause it was hour before she came back . i was parched for some water . although they gave us our food for free it was just inexcusable . have had better massages at massage envy will not be going back"
1,love this studio ! teachers are nice and accomodating . this is possibly one of the best yoga classes i have studied . this is a place where you sweat your ass off while listening to music and meditating . love sumits yoga and love the studio in chandler . best part is the practice is expanding so check out the website . www . sumitsyoga . com
1,i used full circle auto body after my daughter s car was in an accident . they were very knowledgable and helpful about insurance issues and got the car repaired quickly . they post progress of your vehicle with photos on their website which is so cool . i ll definitely use them again if the occassion arises . 
0,"i have been coming to xtreme bean for several years and it is still a generally good place . the coffee is average or below , the tea selection is good , the atmosphere is ok but same old . the current staff is incredibly immature and act like children yelling , and even barking , at high decibels . i ve never seen anything like it anywhere . i ll have to think twice about coming back if this continues .

1,"they get five stars now . you know why ? three little words i long to hear gluten free buns ! ok , technically that s two words , but i love them nonetheless ! the buns are a dollar extra , but if you are like me and are tired of eating a burger with a lettuce wrap , or worse , with cutlery , just for the illusion of a sense of normalcy , they are worth it . and , frankly , quite tasty . i don t know if all rr are serving them now , or from the same bakeries distributors , but i for one am glad for it !

1,"i am always on the prowl for a good burger so when i heard there was a new burger place in tempe i knew i had to try it out . the boyfriend and i went to lobby s on a friday night . it was not busy but the location doesn t really lend itself to busy . so we were able to walk right in and order . it s an order at the counter and grab a seat kinda place . we both ordered cheeseburgers and got an order of fries to share . i liked that the burgers were not pre made frozen patties . they threw down two hunks of beef on the grill . the burgers were tasty , a nice size not too big , not too small and the fixin s were fresh . so was the bun . the fries were crinkle cut but they were crispy and good . the atmosphere was fine , good for a quick sit down and the staff was friendly . i hope they can survive in this location because they are worth a repeat visit for sure .

1,"this place is so busy it is most definitely not a hidden gem , although it sits back in the neighborhood . the food and coffee are good but most of all , i like that i can walk my dog here to get coffee and the newspaper on the weekend . i wish that there were more places that allowed pets outside . the parking can be a pain and the ordering and picking up of food can be chaotic . but , once you get settled this is a good place to visit .

1,"this place far exceeded my expectations and is far better than staying at a hilton garden inn or hampton inn . this place is quiet , clean and for the money , you can t beat this place . it includes a hot breakfast each day which means real eggs and hash browns served to you at a sit down cafe . this alone saves about per person per day while traveling ! this place has three pools nice if you don t want to hang out near the bar , basketball court , laundry facilities , restaurant , plenty of parking , free wi fi , full kitchen , great housekeeping service they cleaned our dirty dishes ! , and a very courteous front desk staff . the only downsides were the dim lighting and not enough wastebaskets or tissue boxes . but for the peace and quiet , i ll take that trade off anyday ! ! this place would be excellent for hosting reunions because of the pools , basketball courts and several sets of bbq s on central courtyards . if you are looking for a fancy place , this isn t it . but it is an incredible bargain , comfortable , and very quiet .

0,"went here because of a groupon , will probably not go back without one . cons overpriced , flat out . plus , like other reviewers have said , they run out of a lot of good stuff . also , i know this is something small , but as their menu changes , they should update it online . had i known the menu would be so different , i would have waited for another week to get a meal i would actually want as opposed to settling . also , we had reservations and had to wait minutes . not a huge deal , but a personal pet peeve . pros the food was good , but like i said , overpriced . since i had a deal , i didn t mind as much . atmosphere is nice , and i loved the extras we got a few small tasting , palate cleansers ? . the cotton candy was fab , and though the strawberry dessert was not my first choice , it was truly delicious , and i may go back just for that dish ! i love the location , and the staff was incredibly friendly , informative , and courteous . knock down the prices and i d give it at least stars !

0,"it s true , there is a real bull and a slide . this place has been around forever , i think my parents used to go there back in the s . i can t say much about the food since i ve only been here for happy hour , which was pretty decent . their hh included top shelf for bucks and some cheap beers . they also have appetizers on the hh menu , sliders , quesadillas and potato skins , that sort of stuff . pretty nice view and going during happy hour you can see all the people sitting in traffic on the and cheers them from the balcony .

1,"this is a standard place to celebrate birthdays . the drinks are delicious especially the kiwi and acai specialty drinks . the rolls are over , but they are unique and tasty . the environment is very cool and the location is great . parking is bad just like everywhere in scottsdale , you need to park in the street . location is great because you can grab dinner here and then go out after . there is also karaoke available if you want to rent a room for a special occasion . "
1,"i m so happy they put a location in old town . i had been to the location in south phoenix before and it was awesome as well . i had the chopped bbq which is turkey , chicken , and beef all chopped up and cooked in bbq sauce . it was very very tasty . they gave me two pieces of bread to make a sandwich and with the lb order i still had more left over . for my side i got the texas cream corn which i really enjoy . it has great flavor and is an excellent compliment to the bbq . the location has a nice patio for the great weather we are having and you can also sit inside on picnic style tables .

1,"prepare to spend a few hours here and really have a romantic experience . the food is divine . the service is laid back in a good way . the chef runs the whole show and plays all hats . the menu is forever changing and when you make a reservation he will ask you questions so he can tailor your meal and experience to your needs . probably not a good first date place because if the date goes wrong , you will be stuck for a while . perfect spot for an anniversary or something . or even just to have a nice meal with people you know and care about .

1,"fez is right down the street from where i work , hence due to its location general fabulousness , it has become a regular spot for happy hour . here s what we love about fez sweet potato fries sooo good sprinkled with cinnamon by the way kisra and hummus ! the black bean burger the first time i ordered it , i asked the server now , is this one of those really bad black bean burgers or does it actually taste good ? she said , i totally know what you mean , no this one is good . and she was right ! margarita mondays aka for one margaritas check out the pomegranate one ! ! the atmosphere blue and green tones while still being warm the friendly service the close proximity to light rail here s what we don t like as much the slow service sometimes it gets kind of bad , i feel like you have to be an active restaurant goer and hail down your server otherwise you may never get to order , get more water another drink , or get your check when happy hour ends i mean , who likes that anywhere ? fez makes me very happy to work in downtown phoenix .

1,"i ve only been to the mic times but so far so good . at this time i have taken only the spin classes and i must say the room is amazing . the lights are awesome , the mirrored doors that open to the outdoors are very cool . last week todd opened the doors and we did spinning in the rain . it was so much fun . i also have to agree with the reviewer , emily , that todd s class is fantastic . it is filled with energy , great music , and is a very challenging ride . the one complaint i have is that the class is only minutes , i would prefer it be an hour especially given the cost . i cannot comment on the yoga as i have not tried it but the yoga room also looks amazing . the cafe is a nice addition and the menu items that i have tried have all been great . i will definitely continue to do todd s class when i can and hope to try out a couple of other instructors in the future .

0,tooooooo crowded ! ! that takes all the fun of the place . as a mountain is a nice place to go up without feeling that you will loose your lungs . going down feels faster than up . being in regular shape it took us about minutes to go up . a moderate hike and doable by all the family . 
0,"ok , i am new in town so i was unaware that they are trying to change the name of this event to the great arizona picnic , or something of the like . well , thank god because when i hear culinary , my mind certainly does not think of dos gringos . . . or any of the other vendors represented at this event . and why the hell , after paying to enter , would i pay again to enter the fenced areas ! ? wtf ! ? i come from a town where festivals are managed better than most corporations so i believe that i am spoiled , but there is no excuse for the long lines encountered here . i counted over people in line waiting for pizza . . . pizza ! lines to enter , lines to use the atm , lines to purchase tickets , lines to eat , lines to pee . . . . . . obviously i feel passionate about this particular review , and for those that love this festival , i apologize . i will say that many people with whom i had spoken who had been coming to this festival for years said that it is no longer what it once was . on a positive note , the people watching is tremendous . i have never seen so many beautiful people in one location in my life . and i would agree that it all depends on the company . great friends make this a fun event . "
1,"this is a cool spot . it does live up to its name in that the restaurant has a posh , bistro like ambience to it . you can get burgers like a la carte by getting them in oz , oz , or oz sizes , so it s possible to mix and match to try different burgers . i had the wagyu kobe beef and the lamb , and they were pretty average . meat wasn t extremely tender or anything and the bun was so so . sweet potato fries and onion rings were really good though . they have several four peaks and grand canyon pilsner on tap . i think overall the food is par to a cut above par , but i don t think i go there for the food it s definitely a fun experience everytime you eat at stax and the varieties of burgers are what makes it . check it out !

1,"the name is so misleading , because this is the most charming dining spot i ve ever eaten ! i dined here for lunch with a friend and was blown away by everything about it . first , it s location is tucked away near asu campus in a quiet little neighborhood . it appears to be a converted home built in the early s and lots of beautiful mature trees and plants growing in their huge , and i mean huge outdoor patio area . i only dined outside , but honestly with such beautiful weather months out of the year here , why would you dine any other way ! the service was excellent ! the staff was extremely attentive and always checked up on me while i drank water and waited a while for my friend . the menu was amazing . i never once read a menu that i wanted to try everything on here . they had a huge variety of dishes at what i can only describe as american french fusion . it all looked so divine . and from what i ve been told , their menu changes frequently to new seasonal dishes . so i can t wait to see what they offer when i return . i went simple with my meal having this delicious quiche , fresh fruit and a cup of their corn chowder soup . the soup was so rich and creamy , i could have ordered and ate a whole trough ! it was that good . the fruit was clean , well portioned and fresh . i m very particular with fruit , and hate when the fruit looks soggy and overly ripened . and the quiche was heavenly as well . just the right amount of ham and tomatoes with alot of flavor . since i was here for lunch only , the prices were reasonable . i ve heard at dinner it can get expensive . this was an unforgettable dining experience and recommend this to everyone to try at least once .

1,"grassroots is right around the corner and we drive by it every week on our usual friday dinner out . i always assumed it was more of a pub than a restaurant . my wife and i arrived around pm and were seated immediately . the waiter was super attentive and knew the menu and preparation of everything i asked about . we started with an amazing appetizer special of burrata with ciabatta tips , their house spicy tomato jam and arugula with champagne vinaigrette . it was described as a sort of an experimental combination of preparations from other dishes . the burrata was silky smooth and spreads onto the ciabatta like softened cream cheese . the play of flavors in this dish was excellent , we d go back here just for this dish alone . my wife ordered the lobster bisque as her entree , which was smooth and creamy with a good lobster flavor . i suspect we could have asked for bread on the side , but it didn t come with it by default . i ordered the short ribs with roasted asparagus and jalapeno cheddar grits . the ribs were cooked just right , just a little pink and tender with a concentrated glaze of delicious sauce layered on top . the sauce had a light smoky flavor with a fair amount of saltiness , and appeared to be a long simmered reduction with bold flavor . as others have mentioned , the jalapeno grits are very good , not spicy by any means but a little crunch from the jalapeno pieces , creamy and well prepared . i strongly recommend the short ribs to anyone . we splurged with dessert of key lime pie and a banana split . the split included three large scoops of what appeared to be homemade ice cream and topped with caramelized pecans . the key lime was tart and delicious . the portion sizes were perfect and considering the careful preparation and unique flavors the price was appropriate . it s a little more expensive that i would like to put grassroots into our weekly rotation , but i look forward to visiting it again and sample more items off the menu when the budget allows . i didn t know what burrata was http en . wikipedia . org wiki burrata"

0,"my expectations were exceeded ! i ve been searching for so long to have a dinner experience that met all of my expectations for a restaurant that i should never patronize . mimi s in goodyear actually exceeded my expectations . on oct th , while visiting the area , i made the unfortunate mistake of recommending we dine at mimi s because of previously good food and service there . but , alas , if the old mimi s quality still existed , they wouldn t have exceeded my expectations for what not to experience in a restaurant . let me recant why you or any one else except those people you truly dislike should never patronize this facility . first of all , the interior temperature was at least degrees when it was less than outside . we had to ask for the air conditioning to be turned on . next , we ordered the artichoke dip appetizer . it looked funny . it tasted funny . the tortilla chips actually resembled pita chips . if it walks like a duck , quacks like a duck , it must be a ______ . i ordered the chicken cordon bleu which is supposed to be served with seasonal vegetables and homemade mashed potatoes . can someone explain to me how mixed seasonal vegetables can be served where the brocolli is steaming hot , but the carrots mixed with them are literally still frozen in the middle ? that s a feat . my homemade mashed potatoes ? cold . a sliver of butter placed on top of the mashed potatoes would not even melt to graphically show our waitress the problem . even after this effort , no offer from the wait staff or manager missing in action was ever made to either warm up the potatoes , replace them . . . . . . or , perhaps , use them as wall spackling . after all this , they sincerely asked us if everything was all right and would we care to order dessert . at least they have a sense of humor . never again .

0,"the arizona science center offers a series of programs called adult s night out which are held the first friday of every month . these lectures cover focused overviews on topics ranging from genetics and nanotechnology to native american medicinal utilization of native plants found in the southwest . there is always interesting science or engineering content but the value and interest of the talks is essentially the somewhat direct non mass media poisoned or dumbed down views of the individual speakers themselves . while i would attend the talks regardless i have found additional value in the evening because of the extended hours that the science center offers which allows you to catch an imax film and see the latest flavor of exhibit body worlds , titanic , etc . after the lecture . i would have loved to have given the science center stars but i am constantly annoyed by the science center s staff inability to get one of the three microphones set up correct for the speakers ahead of time causing a speaker to waste minutes every month . beer and wine are available for purchase during the event . the adult s night out lectures are free , normal planetarium , imax , and special exhibit prices still apply . arizona science center web site www . azscience . org adult s night out www . azscience . org adults_night_out . php"

1,"super fun ! ! ! i haven t been to this park in years so i definitely was overdue for a fun and wet time ! ! ! i went this past saturday with my friend and although there were a lot of people there it was far from crowded ! the longest line i had to wait in was for that toilet bowl type slide . . which was super scary for me , btw . i would rate this place with stars however , their food selection is very unhealthy and ridiculously expensive . my friend and i wanted to bring snacks healthy sandwiches water bottles inside but our ticket voucher stated that food drinks were prohibited , bummer . prior to heading to sunsplash , we filled up on a super yummy filling breakfast at cracker co , conveniently located less than a mile from the waterpark ! about hours into our wet wild time , we did take a break and treat ourselves to two large icees for , nuts . . right ? . . and before we left we had a scoop of ice cream each for . . each . ha . as i was chowing down , i looked over to my friend and said , we could buy a half gallon of ice cream for the price of this one scoop ! sheesh . . whatever , it was worth it . . we supported our economy that day . you re welcome economy ! lol over all , i had a blast acting like a dork reliving my teens . there were tons of lifeguards on staff they helped keep everything safe , organized , and everyone happy . i am planning on gathering more people , including my boyfriend to go this weekend too ! we might try a different park though , just to keep things fresh ! the wave pool , the lazy river , the variety of slides , the lily pad cross . . . sunsplash is a summer time must !

1,"with a few hours past and a few tasks accomplished the next stop of my day would be at pane bianco the sandwich shop from the valley s most celebrated chef , chris bianco . having made my pilgrimage to the eponymous pizzeria during my first trip to phoenix , pane had been on my radar since the day i moved to town but given the lunch only hours and my office location in north scottsdale i knew a weekend would be best and as luck would have it a new website http www . pizzeriabianco . com and seven day a p schedule had been rolled out just the week prior . arriving at the surprisingly large space especially when compared to matt s and jobot from earlier that day and compared to pizzeria bianco as well shortly after and allocating parking in the free lot juxtaposing the light rail i debated for a moment whether dine in or to go was best and opting for the former made my way into the restaurant where two couples already sat . greeted by one of two servers it was suggested i could take any seat i wanted and opting for a bench in the center of the room where a menu awaited i sat down to browse the menu as well as the daily specials listed on the chalkboard almost all sounding appealing , but a bit different than the saturday special listed on the website . with a small list of beverages available i was asked soon if i was ready to order or if i needed a few minutes i deferred and requested a glass of water that would never reach even half empty despite me drinking from it consistently and the restaurant soon filling to capacity . having debated the specials but eventually undeterred from the reason i d come in the first place i soon placed my order for a sandwich and an appetizer which i was told would be just a few minutes and as while i waited i checked out the small market at the take away section featuring the famous focaccia , cans of tomatoes , dried pasta , and apparel before returning to my seat where my items would arrive shortly the first a manchego and tomato sauce focaccia del giorno featuring bianco s delectable wood fired focaccia in all of its spongy glory topped with sweet , ripe tomatoes and an ample layer of briny manchego at . probably the most expensive grandma slice i ve ever had yet at the same time also probably the best . . . or at least on par with that at difara in brooklyn for best of its genre . moving next to the original target of my desire , a sandwich of bianco s house made mozzarella , tomatoes , and basil on wood fired focaccia my first thought was wow that is a lot of cheese while my second , after a bite , was wow that is a lot of flavor . perhaps as pure of a sandwich as you can find and the result of exquisite ingredients on top quality bread there is really nothing special about the composition of this sandwich aside from the fact that it simply works a largely unmanipulated masterpiece only improved by a touch of sea salt and cracked black pepper . largely unaware on entering that pane serves dessert it was with much delight that i realized soon after sitting down that three options were available that day and while the flourless chocolate cake i saw emerge from the kitchen to the table next to me looked quite nice there was simply no way i was passing up the organic vanilla bean rice pudding with candied pecans another simplistic stunner with creamy arborio rice imbued with a rich vanilla custard flicked with whole vanilla beans and a few pecans for crunch . delicate and smooth , flavorful without being overly sweet , and almost thick enough to stand a spoon up straight it was not quite the best rice pudding i ve ever had but a top five contender without a shadow of a doubt a reason in and of itself to return to pane bianco . . . though to be fair , if i returned it would take pretty spectacular daily specials to prevent me from ordering the exact same trio of items once again . with chris and his team now two for two it is only a matter of time before i make my way to italian restaurant . . . and honestly , that time is likely measured in hours and days as opposed to weeks and months .

0,"trust me . . . no one wants this place to do well more than me . however , after visits i have to confess that it is a solid stars . i m confident in my comments . . . and maybe a little heartbroken . . loved chef wade moises when he was at sassi in scottsdale . i m a fan for god s sake . . i m a big pasta crazed fool . seriously love it . . love dwntwn phx . so what could go wrong ? service no one to greet you properly at the door . the space is awkward enough as it is . staff was always inattentive and often seen hanging out at the bar . when asked why cocktails the signature cocktails took so long to prepare , the server responds clumsily because i had to read and learn how to make them just now . yikes . back to the greeting . . . we waited about minutes in the doorway listening to staff sitting at the bar chat about how they hoped they could close early that night . it was only pm . vibe the space feels cold and almost clinical . with the lack of fabric in the space , it feels like i m the er of a hospital minus the curtains that surround each patient bed . the staff certainly doesn t add warmth . also reminds me of a corporate staff break room . art on the walls is just bizarre read other s comments . the cocktails they look good on paper . see my comment above about service . that s all i can really say . the food each time , the fritto misto app was salty and sad to look at . orecchiette with sausage looks fantastic on paper , but never quite right . in fact , i ve tried every pasta dish on the menu . i m simply heartbroken . i crave handmade fresh pasta , but the pasta here just leaves me guessing . . . i m i the odd ball out ? why do all these yelpers love the pasta ? it s wimpy and the proteins almost taste boiled texture and flavor . approx quote from a guest , gummy handmade pasta that looks like bloated playdoh in water . the sauces seem near amateur as if they were never tasted before serving . usually on the salty side . forget about portions , price , space , ambiance , whatever . the important question . . . does it taste good ? sadly , no . at each visit , i brought other notable chefs from the valley . in one instance , the five of us ordered an entire dinner , ate a few bites of each dish , asked for the bill and decided to head next door to sens for dinner which is another review in the making . i ll wait till sometime in the fall season before heading back to pasta bar . maybe it needs more time although it s been open for a few months already . as always , i d encourage you to try it out and make your own decision . wade is a talented chef who can do amazing things in the kitchen . i have faith in you my friend ! side note . . . for those of you who fixate on butter and bread service at restaurants , do us all a favor and stick to your cheap filler salad bars . bread and butter service is simply never worth commenting on as a crucial component of a meal unless it s stellar . btw . . . i realize the irony of making commentary on the worthless comments "
1,"shimogamo has been one of my favorites for a few years now so , i thought it was time to give them a yelp ! every time i visit i am always greeted by the owner yoshi who happens to be japanese and runs the restaurant as such . fish is always fresh and consistently high quality , sushi chefs are friendly and always willing to let you try something new . they also have a nice selection of cold sake s available and some random ones in stock off the menu if you ask the owner . atmosphere is very modern contemporary and in a small suite located next to c fu gourmet . they also have a traditional japanese seating room in the back that is fun for larger groups etc . . if you are a sushi lover or even a newbie to this style , you will love it !

0,"don t know where i should start . grand opening was on september th , . we went to try this new dim sum place at the mekong plaza as they heavily advertised in the chinese newspapers and were advertising off . when i got there , the biggest eyesore is that they tried to make their portion of the food court as a regular chinese restaurant . so imagine the picture of chandeliers hanging in the middle of a food court in the mall . it just looks too tacky , i thought they should ve went with a more fast food type dim sum like they have in san gabriel , california . upon checking in with the hostess , they don t even issue numbers , they only call you by name . so that was already pretty different from how usual chinese restaurant run things . totally not efficient at all . once we finally got a seat , things got worse . our har gow shrimp dumpling was raw ! the skin was thick and clumpy , the shrimp was severely undercooked . we asked them to exchange for another one , and it was still raw . we also had to exchange the shrimp egg roll as it was also raw . their excuse was that they were too busy and did not have time to fully cook the food . ok . . . . . so how are the other s of asian restaurants able to serve dim sum at a fast pace with fully cooked food ? that was probably the lamest excuse . the trademark beef internal organs that i always love to order was pathetic . they charged the large price for a tiny little bowl , there were only a few tendons and mostly filled with daikon . the bbq pork bun , another staple of dim sum , was not that great either . there was barely any char siu in the bun , and the exterior of the bun was not fully cooked . i understand that it is their first operating weekend , but the idea of a nice chinese dimsum place at a food court just doesn t fly in my opinion . they even offer wedding banquets here too . i don t think i ll be returning here unless they really upgrade the quality of the food . the idea is definitely novel , but will be a hard sell .

1,"i had to do some painting and needed help locating items and suggestions from the staff and boy were they ever helpful . nothing like home depot , where you have to go and hunt down an employee and when you do they can t wait to get back to their break or whatever was more important than their customer . i was just overwhelmed by the courteous and quick service i received at this location . even their quality of garden plants surpassed several other super stores .

1,"the other day , had a lunch from there . no , didn t eat at the restraint , but we picked up a very sizable lunch for a family reunion . the lady that helped us was very gracious , and accommodating . i know , how can someone helping with take out be accommodating , because , my sister , being the wild and crazy type and to accommodate her husband ordered pasteles uncooked , just as raw as can be . why , so he could freeze some for thanksgiving . that s the puerto rican in him . a holiday is better when it reminds you of childhood . the food was excellent , the ropa viejo nice and tender . the paradise pork i think that s what it was was also very good . and didn t taste like a pig . the only good part of a pig for me is the other food group bacon ! and we all discovered deep fried plantains , excellante . dessert was rich , sensual , wonderful and sexy !

1,"the name says it all . this family owned restaurant to be exact specializes in tortas but they also carry your staple mexican fast food affair you would find in az . everything i or anyone else has had has been solid . just in case you don t know what a torta is , the best way i can explain what one is that it is essentially a toasted sandwich with a fusion of mexican and american ingredients . when it comes to teg s tortas , there are a few standouts . one would be the cochinita . cochinita which is marinated pork is absolutely delicious by itself , but in a torta , it is absolutely scrumptious ! ! ! my best description of what cochinita is to think of pulled pork that is braised in a slightly sweet , salty , and spicy redish orangeish sauce . in addition , it has american sandwich staples such as mayo , shredded lettuce . what makes it a torta are the slices of sweet and sour pickled jalapenos and carrots and slices of avocado and they do not skimp . what completes the sandwich , i mean torta , is the bread . it s always warm and fluffy in the inside and the outside always has a nice crisp texture from the grill . the other torta i would strongly recommend is the carne asada . the combination of the carne asada steak with mayo , fresh pico de gallo , and lettuce along with the warm bread makes this torta an absolute winner my mouth is actually watering just thinking about it ! . the cubana , which has your typical ingredients that come with any spin on the classic cuban , is also good . if you are a big fan of cubans , then this one may be for you . but in my humble opinion , this does not anywhere near come close to the yummy goodness of the cochinita and carne asada . the hawiiana hawaiian is also a relative good choice . with the combination of ham and fresh grilled pineapple along with other condiments , it also is descent selection . as i stated before , they do have staple arizona style mexican fast food here and there are a few i would recommend . one would be the flautas large deep fried rolled tacos . the pollo is the one i would suggest . if you envision your typical fried rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese , well this is not that , this is even better ! the flautas at teg are larger with much more stuffing then your typical rolled tacos . in addition , they make them with yummy flour tortillas , not your typical corn . the shredded chicken is well seasoned and moist . the tortilla is always fried perfectly , light crisp on the outside with the inside of the tortilla still soft . the burritos here are good , actually better than average , but because the tortas here are the showcase , everything else takes a backseat . the rice and beans are hit and miss , especially at the chandler location . i used to give teg four and a half stars , but with the mistake of expanding too quickly , combined with quality and consistency falling a bit , i would have to give them three and half stars four stars would be stretching . i m anal so three and three quarter seems to fit . for example , the phoenix location , which the son runs and where he started the chain has a few issues . for example , the cochinita at the phoenix location is always drier and saltier than the other two locations . in addition , they have certain items only at that location that the other two do not . one would be their sonoran style hotdogs , which are excellent and an item i would highly recommend . when i have gone to both the mesa and chandler location and asked for them , and unfortunately they said they don t carry them . i was disappointed to say the least . another example of inconsistency is the last time i went to the chandler location . i brought a couple of out of town guests , and i was a little disappointed because the bread was a little too bready dense and not light and fluffy as usual . when all the ingredients are in perfect symphony , you have one amazing torta , but when one ingredient is off such as something like the bread being too dense throws off that harmonious balance of flavors and textures . in this case , it made a difference from a four and half star sandwich to a star sandwich which is still good in my book , but not great . the best and most consistent is their mesa location . i think that it is because mom and pops run that particular location well they used to anyways . everything has always been consistently delici oh so good . overall , would i still recommend tortas el guero , and do i still go ? yes , but i wouldn t rave about the place like i once did especially with the inconsistencies i ve experienced as of late .

1,i ve been to joe s bobby q s but dave s takes the bbq on this one ! we got dave s family portions for one of our many tailgating experiences . we tried all of there dishes and the beef brisket was delicious as was the pulled pork . and don t forget the cornbread muffins . while this is a place you cannot go often or you will be the pig ! its worth the calories every now and then ! ! 
1,"i ve often driven by here , figured i d go in take a look sometime . but i was looking for a clock mini speaker system that i use with my iphone . when i had my g , i had a very bad experience where i was assured that a particular clock mini speakers i bought would work with it but all it had was a cheap plastic adapter that the g kept falling out of then they gave me a hard time about a refund . this time , i was again getting either glib reassurances non specific information , sorry out of stock s , or no open floor samples i could look at , at other stores including the big a store with a lot of jobs , not to mention conflicting info on amazon upon googling . so i thought to go into the istore . boy , was i pleasantly surprised ! they had open , plugged in items that i could actually test my iphone in to make sure it worked . even better , i began chatting with the guys there about various other iphone macbook pro issues , found they had far more knowledge about both the phone it s peripherals and macbook pro s and honesty about them than i ever got from the really really smart folks at the big a store with jobs who will promise you anything . so , i would definitely go back there for honest advice i would certainly bring in anything that needed warranty service . they also have a pretty nice selection of peripherals and better yet , they know what works with what !

1,"i just have to tell you that this place is amazing . not only is the food top notch so is the service . it is a rare find to get awesome food , a comfortable environment and excellent service at a reasonable price all rolled into one . the homemade sausage is excellent , the pizza is perfect , the choice of deli meats is extensive and homemade side salads red potato dill is my favorite and everything on the menu is fantastic . i have read that people say the wait is long , which i find unfounded but when you are considering what you are getting , the wait means nothing . i have waited longer for sysco reheated food in a restaraunt bleh and had worse service . i would take a min longer wait for really good , fresh food any day . if you can t appreciate that then maybe chain restaurants is where you should stay . we really do our best to stay away from those and finding places like defalco s is really tough . we will continue to be loyal customers and spread the word of one our favorite places to eat . don t pass the opportunity to try this place ! !

1,"well , it s fresh , and it s easy . perfect words to describe this cute , clean little store ! this was my fave f e in phoenix because it was a mere block and a half from my place . i still miss it , and i moved away from phx over a year ago ! i popped in here several times a week to pick up staples , it was always an adventure to see which prices had been marked down they even have a section in cold foods where they mark older stuff way down . i appreciated their little bundles of veggies which were sold in just right amounts as in , not so much that some of it will end up going bad . this market was also great for soups their brand was my pick , although they have a selection of major brands as well it was also my go to place for prepared healthful lunches perfect for work like the f e pre made burritos and pasta dishes . check out frozen foods too there are reasonably priced items like tempura , and special organic seafood dishes i never found anywhere else . i also liked the casual setup of the checkout area , with the option for a cashier or self serve . and . . . wait for it . . . i just found out they are opening at least two f es in sacramento ! ! ! okay , that won t likely cause much of a stir with the phoenix crowd , but i am so excited they ll be open in my area !

1,"i stayed here for work and had some meetings in the area which made the location very convenient for me . i just hopped in my car and was at my office minutes later . the hotel seemed pretty new ish and there were free cookies at check in . there is also a restaurant downstairs and a gym if you re into that sort of thing . my room was clean and well kept . my only minor complaint about the room would be that the air conditioning is super loud ! there are a couple of restaurants right outside , but they close pretty early . other than that there isn t too much close by , but if you drive up the street a few blocks to happy valley , you can find every big box store and chain restaurant imaginable .

1,"okay , this just might sum it up . . . i love yogurtland with all of my heart ! go get some yogurt , the end . no but seriously , do go . all of these yogurt places have been popping up everywhere the past couple years , and when mojo opened up at the biltmore i loved it , but it was far away . then , yogurtland opened up right next to where i live and i discovered it was better ! sooo many flavors , and they change a few of them out every once in awhile . they have all the normal yogurt toppings , plus white chocolate sauce , chocolate sauce , and caramel sauce . hello ? isn t this supposed to be healthy ? haha , it actually is if you take advantage of their freshly cut fruit . i just love it . i took my brother and he is the first person i ve seen to grab the biggest cup they have , i asked him why and he said , it s so good , i can take some home and put it in the freezer for later . my favorite is pistachio yogurt with gummie bears ! record is times in one week . . . message me if you ve beat that .

1,"i first visited this restaurant after my friend pushed me to visit the hawaiian festival at the tempe town lake a few months ago . big deal , i thought . how can a hawaiian festival be fun ? well , the food was amazing . and after having half a rotisserie chicken , i was craving for more . a few days later , i finally began my search for the perfect or near perfect hawaiian restaurant , in which i can satisfy my hawaiian cravings . my first stop was mai island grill , located in near the arizona state university campus . parking was a bit of a challenge this is especially true during the lunch hour . when i finally found a parking spot , i went in and ordered . i had the short ribs plate . the plates include one scoop of macaroni salad and steamed rice . after placing my order for the short ribs , i ordered the spam musubi . the guy preparing food replied with a laugh . is it good ? i asked jay the man who operates this restaurant replied , yes it s good . then he said something about how the guy who laughs never laughs or something like that . about minutes later , my food was ready . the food was fantastic just what i was looking for ! the prices are very reasonable . plates are about and less . i also suggest that you try the fish , beef , grilled chicken , and pork katsu . and finally , i hope that this place continues to provide the same liberal portions . also , i think it would be cool if mai island grill began serving two scoops of macaroni salad and two scoops of rice just a fantasy of mine . additional notes cash only . opens late in the morning and closes early in the afternoon call for exact hours . there never seems to be any lumpia !

1,"lovato s was the first place that i ever went to spend more than dollars on a haircut . they are awesome . the place is family owned , and art and his son scott both had their turn at cutting my nappy hair and made it look spectacular ! i have since opted for someplace closer but often miss conversing with scott about working out with his ultimate fighting friends . he often had the bruises to prove it . art would generally blow dry my hair making it slightly poofy and not unlike his own frankie avalon style , but once i got home and styled it on my own , the cut was perfect . mrs . lovato , whose first name i really wish i could remember , always offered some ice cold lemonade while i waited and i always felt like an honored guest . scotts kids can often be found sweeping the floors in the summer and they are about the cutest things you will ever see . for guys that like a masculine place to get their haircut , but want time and attention given to their look at the same time , this place is perfect . they do all that chicky stuff too including waxings but i can t say that i got experience from them on that end .

0,"i do love chinese food , and for such a big city i find that phoenix or at least scottsdale lacks in options , either because they aren t the most welcoming of places , or simply because there aren t that many compared to sushi restaurants for example . i ve been to this location maybe times since moving to phoenix years ago and must say that i usually go because a friend as a pei wei craving . i found the food to be ok , but i m typically one who doesn t like spicy food as i find it takes away instead of enhances the flavor . i wasn t too hungry and decided to take the chicken fried rice . i have to say that my favorite chicken fried rice is the one from tottie s in scottsdale that not only is delicious but always gives me left overs for lunch the next day . portion was ok though the fried rice was a little sweet and the person i was dining with had the chicken lettuce wrap which wasn t too bad either . service was disappointing as our food took about minutes to come , but i must say the staff was helpful when i was asked where to get takeaway boxes as well as a takeaway cup . i d give it stars if after a handful of experiences i had pei wei on my must have list but with pita jungle , sack s , subway , rubio s , etc . nearby , the competition for fast casual is stiff and pei wei just doesn t cut it for me unless i really had a craving for asian food that day .

1,"i came to this place for my birthday celebration with my fiance and another couple . i was definitely in a good mood . the food first , the salad bar . i am not much of a veggie lover , but the selection here is impressive , especially in light of this being a place where you eat the cow , not the cow s food . besides a variety of veggies and dressings , you have a few cold cut meats , cheeses and smoked salmon to select from . from personal experience , tomatoes are good , all cheeses and meats are too . salmon was simply delicious . for the main course , it s all sorts of meat , mostly varieties of beef plus lamb and chicken . i liked all of them , but most of the beef was a salty to my taste hence the loss of a star . some of it can be explained by my getting the first cut off the meat several times , which meant that i got the salt seasoning in addition to the salt in the meat . that aside , the meat is high quality and the main objective here is to remember not to get too much too soon , so you can enjoy everything the place has to offer . sides were small as they should be and included polenta , mashed potatoes and fried bananas . all good . the wine selection is extensive and from our limited tasting , quite good . we had cabernet and malbec . setting this is a rather large stand alone restaurant , but has surprisingly personal feeling , especially if you consider the amount of staff running around . it is not too brightly lit and has generally darker tones to the interior . there is also a cozy bar to the side of the main entrance that is a pleasant place to wait for others to arrive . service attentive and not at all pushy . overall i came here in a good mood and left in an even better mood and feeling like a python after eating a cow . which was close enough to true amount of food in me . highly recommend this both for the experience and the food itself .

1,"thanks to yelp i was able to find this hidden jewel . the place looks like a spanish style motel converted into a restaurant . with a cute garden in the back . i had already eaten so didn t intend on a nd breakfast . but stingy gf only allowed me a few bites so i had to ask chris to whip up another plate for me . it was my first time having chilled salmon done that way and it was so good . everything tasted so fresh . for the price you get to drink all you want . and i must have had at least glasses of the orange juice with mixed berries . the food and the atmosphere reminds me of eating in napa , ca . will definitely return when i m in town .

0,"for days out of the week i eat tons of fruits , veggies , nuts , seeds , whole grains , fish , etc . tuesday afternoons is my cheat meal and i really look forward to it . this time i was looking forward to pizza . i love pizza . we dined on tuesday afternoon , the place was kinda empty so we got tons of attention from our waitress who was wonderful . for an appetizer we ordered the rock shrimp with garlic , basil aolioli sp dipping sauce . the shrimp were okay , but needed a more flavorful dipping sauce maybe a spicy marinara or barbecue . for my meal i decided to go with the soup and inch pizza lunch special butternut squash margerita pizza . the soup was actually quite good . the pizza was good , but something was missing . oh yeah , the cheese ! ! ! seriously , do i have to ask for extra cheese on a pizza ? i really look forward to my cheat day and the pizza did not live up to my expectations . for dessert i went with the donut holes drizzled with caramel and sprinkled with powdered sugar . the order is huge , seriously there were no less than donut holes . cheat day or not it was just too much . my husband ordered scoops of vanilla ice cream . after visiting a local ice cream shop where everything is homemade , this ice cream did not come close . long story short , we will visit again only next time we will ask for extra cheese on a cheese pizza .

0,"i visited one sunday afternoon just to check it out in reply to an ad i saw to visit for free for days . typically , when you respond to ads like that from a gym , the staff requests your information such as name , address , phone so they can sell you on a membership later . that was not the case with me . it was very informal . i advised i was not a member and wanted to give their place a shot . the guy in the front desk said come right on in no personal information requested and no tour . i m glad there was no sales pressure . i thought the no tour part was kind of odd , but after doing my walk through , i understand why . the place is not very big . they have weights and cardio machines and the treadmills each had a personal television on the machine . the whole facility appeared clean and there were free towels for the taking for your workout . the lockers in the men s locker room were really nice . they were made brown wood . you can view a sample of the interior of the facility on their website . they looked really classy , but they were not free . there were cabinets offered outside of the locker rooms that you can keep your personals in with a latch that allows you to insert your personal lock on . there was also a small room for classes . i wasn t very impressed with this gym mainly because it was very small . i came during a sunday afternoon when most gyms don t see much traffic so i don t know what it s like during normal high traffic periods such as early mornings and after pm on weekdays . i would imagine that due to the small size of this gym that they cater more to the very local crowd . i wouldn t give this location a poor rating because there wasn t really anything that stood out that was negative other than the limited space and equipment . you might think of this location as the alternative to the larger chain gyms like hour fitness , la fitness , or lifetime fitness . you can always take a look for yourself apparently , they don t provide too much sales pressure for visitors . anyway , that s my say on mountainside fitness at bell rd in north scottsale next to the ice den skating rink .

0,"we used to go to this ups store quite frequently and had been satisfied with their service , but it has been at least a year since we regularly patronized the place . however , we had a really unprofessional experience here recently . we went there for rotary services for purchase of home which one employee refused to do and handed off to another employee because as she under her breath , notary services were a pain . this employee could not help us either as he had never seen anything like it , and he didn t know want to have anything to do with something that had power of attorney on it . i guess we are one of the first people around here to sell a home . while we waited for this man to do something , the employee who handed off our paperwork , tried and failed to scan a document to email and was quite verbal and sorry hickish about these stupid machines . after looking at all was going on , we didn t want anyone here handling our notary services . eek felt like we dodged a bullet . also , don t think i will be going there for any other services . i felt like my iq dropped points when i went in there .

1,"my first experience with pcg was at a small , yet fantastic yelp event . i ve been back twice and have been just as impressed . the first time was for brunch , and i recommend the griddled corn cakes . no , i just don t recommend them , i insist you have them . even if you are allergic to corn , take the plunge and try these . . . unless you might die , then stay away as that might be bad pr for pcg . topped with smoked ham that s what i had , chicken , or bacon and served with maple syrup , it was beyond good . i could eat this dish every day of my life . the black beans were okay , but i do think the breakfast potatoes are nothing special and could be improved upon . i was a big fan of a mimosa , however ! yep , you read that right . . . bucks ! second visit for dinner , and i ordered the cedar planked salmon . a generous piece of fish perfectly cooked and served with a delicious lemon aioli . the accompanying roasted beets were not my thing , and the mashed potatoes were okay maybe i m picky about potatoes ? i also tried a bit of my dining companion s beef tenderloin and it was butter knife tender that s what i cut it with . served with a stuffed potato and mushrooms , i believe , it will most likely be my next entree . for dessert , we shared the jack daniel s croissant bread pudding . we actually shared half , and i most generously took the other half to my husband who i left at home . although , i generally don t care for bread pudding , this is not your typical bread pudding and probably the best bread pudding you can imagine other than that one recipe that uses a dozen krispy kreme doughnuts . although pcg is a little bit of a drive for me outside my usual mile maximum radius , i will happily make that drive and return again .

1,"delicious , fresh , flavorful , with a lot of meat and vegetarian options to please any discerning palate . they also offer soups and salads , which i hear are equally as delicious , and many different options for sides . it s sad to see that this plaza , which used to house michael s and several other stores , is now nearly defunct , and the last remaining vestiges of this plaza s prime days is this deli , pong pong chinese food , which is right next door , and a few other specialty stores . my favorite so far is the southwest wrap . the buena bella vegetarian sandwich , though touted as a healthy alternative , seems to be a bit too salty to make it really that healthy for you .

0,"i went here last night with the bf and another couple , and we all had really high expectations for this place that just weren t met . not to say it was bad , it wasn t , it just didn t live up to the hype . the space is very cute and warm feeling . i like how the chairs don t all match and it has a very homey feel . the service was also very good . the bf ordered their home made ginger ale and it was very interesting . it tasted like liquid ginger , which was pretty cool . for food , we started with the nosh plate , which was probably the best thing we got . it had this delicious onion jam type stuff with some crackers , cashews , some meat of sorts , and a really good cheese with dill on it . the onion on the cheese was soooo good . i could have just eaten that for dinner . then we ordered mains . the bf and i shared the chicken and waffles and our friends got the mac and cheese and the flapjacks . i was not a huge fan of the chicken and waffles , and i was so excited for it ! the waffles weren t crunchy at all , which i think would have been nice texturally , and the chicken was encased in the fried coating , but once you cut into it , the fried part just fell off . it didn t adhere to the chicken at all . also , it was very thick and didn t have a ton of flavor . this was very strange . the sauce on the waffles was good , it was a honey butter or something , and the chicken was moist , but together , it was a disappointment . it did come with some wonderful green beans though . . . . they were seasoned and cooked perfectly . i tried my friend s flapjacks and thought they were a little strange tasting . . . but not bad . i didn t try the mac and cheese , but my friend thought it was good . we finished with a shortcake that has strawberries that were macerated with balsamic and basil and had some kind of cream in it . this was very good , i loved the earthy flavor that the basil brought to the dessert and the strawberries were flavorful and tasted fresh . overall , it was good , but not great . maybe i had too high expectations , but i probably wouldn t run back here in the future .

1,part of the business trip . dinner with the sales team . we always have fun when out on the road and this was no exception . the need for sushi is somtimes primal . this was one of those nights . starting off with happy hour prices that were awesome we easily knocked down three bottles of sake while deciding what treats to order . we ordered a tableful of great sushi alot of variety and had a great time . the one disappointment was that the sushi just didn t have enough spice . not nearly enough heat . the staff was excellent and very helpful . i would recommend ra . the atmosphere alone great music and fun staff is a good reason to go .

1,"if you re in the mood for a foodie adventure , i ve got just the thing . a trip to the caribbean ! head on over to tempe and enter a taste of the caribbean restaurant . the bright yellow and green walls , red floor and outdoor furniture will make you feel like you ve arrived . it s kind of scruffy and laid back this is not the place to come for a quick bite . first of all , you have to make the tough decision about what to order . oxtails or goat ? jerk chicken , of course , or do you want the milder brown stew chicken ? fish ? there s snapper , tilapia , and shrimp . the menu is divided up into caribbean favorites , friday and saturday menu , lunch specials , rice bowl specials and plate specials . if all this has your head spinning , you re not alone . our server , part of the family who own and run the place , seemed equally confused . but she was charming . just accept it , and the slow service as part of the experience don t worry , be happy . we ordered oxtails . and eggplant curry shrimp . . the oxtails , in a brown sauce , were fall off the bone tender , fatty , as oxtails are , and totally delicious . the accompanying plantains were caramelized and a little crunchy . perfection . a huge mound of rice and peas filled the center of the plate moist and beautifully seasoned . and finally , a side of cabbage . there must have been a little sugar in the cooking pan , because it was sinfully delicious . served on the side was a basket of roti , a homemade flatbread , similar to a flour tortilla but much softer . it was so hot we burned our fingers trying to pull off a piece . we had finished off the oxtails when the eggplant dish arrived they were supposed to have come out together it s a good thing we like to share . be forewarned , this curry is not for the faint of mouth . i wasn t expecting the degree of heat my nose started running and my eyes watered . but it was pure bliss , with flavor layered on flavor . the shrimp were perfectly cooked , although i wouldn t have minded a few more , and the eggplant was so tender it was almost melting into the gravy . there were also some pieces of potato , which had not been mentioned on the menu , hiding in there . the heap of rice and peas helped mitigate some of the heat . as you might have gathered , between the roti , the plantains , the rice and peas , and the potatoes , this is a carb lovers paradise . two odd things a wide variety of caribbean sodas are sold here , but no ice tea . and the rest rooms are in a different building than the restaurant . the only disappointment was dessert . i got a pineapple tart to take home i couldn t have eaten another carb if my life depended on it . our server had said it was the best of the two desserts available . uh oh . the tart was really bad a smidgen of decent pineapple filling wedged between layers of leaden dough , tough and greasy . i was glad i hadn t eaten it at the restaurant , because it would have put a bad ending onto an otherwise extraordinary meal .

1,"bosa donuts at southern and mcklintock in tempe is part of a strip mall that i have been visiting since i was just a kid . except , back then , bosa donuts was a taco bell . a few years back taco bell moved a half mile down the road into a new building and bosa donuts set up shop . about a year ago i discovered another new store in this strip mall which is fallout games , an awesome video game store . for this entire last year i ve been driving past bosa on my way out of the complex after visiting fallout games and taking a curious look as i drive by but until this week i had never tried it . after reading all the positive yelp reviews , i had to give it a go . well , first off , it s hours , which is huge in my book since i m almost always up until four or five in the morning . the drive through display is lighted and shows their menu but you have to actually order by pulling up to the window . since i was there at am i asked what was fresh at the moment and the guy was very patient and helpful with listing off what he had available . i just got a few frosted donuts or raised , as they call them and was on my way . right off the bat , i noticed the box was pretty heavy . i only ordered a half dozen but it felt at least as heavy as it does when i get a dozen at dunkin donuts . when i got home , i opened the box and realized their donuts are at least thirty percent bigger than dunkin donuts of krispy kreme . anyway , the donuts are awesome . best tasting donuts i ve ever had . i probably shouldn t make it a habit to come here twice a week , if i want to live past forty , but i ll definitely be stopping by once or twice a month from now on . hope this place sticks around .

0,"u . s . egg is situated directly across the street from denny s . a nicer and classier environment than denny s but the quality of food is similar well , slightly better and a bit pricier . service here was really friendly however . ordered the triple play pancakes , eggs , and bacon but substituted the regular pancakes with their famous protein pancakes which are packed with oatmeal , blueberries and cinnamon . bacon and eggs are always good , tough to mess those up . the protein pancakes had a nice flavor , but the oatmeal which is mixed within the batter before they are poured on to the griddle actually messes with fluffy texture that i enjoy whenever i eat pancakes . if you are really big on breakfast and brunch food and don t want to eat at a nationwide chain restaurant it may be worth it to check this place out , just temper your expectations on the protein pancakes .

1,"stayed here for my best friends birthday . we just wanted a relaxing weekend and that s what we got . we liked that the pool was open . there was a bar at the pool but nobody attending it which blew . so we would have to go inside in our bathing suits to order our drinks since they didn t have a menu outside . people say the rooms are dated , but we thought they were nice . we enjoyed every part of our stay with the exception of the bar out by the pool not being open . if theres a bar , someone should be working it right ?

1,"the bf and i got coffee here last night as part of the coffee tour of phoenix ! ! . the coffee was alright , not too acidic , but not the most flavorful coffee , but the main reason for the star review is they are open late and they deliver ! how awesome ! the people who work there were all friendly . the ice cream looked good . . . will have to try in the future .

1,"i was also roped in with a flier on my door , and ordered this a month or so ago when they had their deal for free cookies , salad , and drink with a pizza order . upon delivery , i was given another coupon for the same deal and a few weeks later received a handwritten thank you note for ordering with them and a coupon for a free order of cheesy bread , no purchase necessary . needless to say , this has become a go to pizza option for me . stars for food taste and quality , an extra for great service and good deals . salad is pretty average but good enough for me with a pizza , pizza is particularly good , cookies are awesome , cheesy bread is cheesy enough but not just a pile of melted cheese . their sauce is really tasty tastes fresh and not too sweet . delivery is free , and on time . the longest time i ve been quoted for a pizza at on a saturday was minutes , and they got there in minutes i wasn t timing them but i did notice how quick they got there . they have a hot n ready special that s only a dollar more than little sleazer s and ten times better . and if you don t think it s good , you get your money back . so really , you should just try it . okay ? okay .

1,"last saturday night i got my skate on . . . . before going out to indulge in more adult good times i had a fucking blast and have decided that next time i go , everyone i know is going with me . yes , that means you ! my date picked me up around ish and immediately made reference to the size of my huevos for wearing a red rag into the . like anyone s going to believe a yr old white girl at a skating rink is a gang banger . he was joking obviously . . . . called me pac all night . . . it was cute , whatever . upon arrival i noticed that indeed , it is pretty street in there . no biggie , i grew up in tucson where our skate rink was filled with cholos and meth heads . i don t judge , i high five . one thing was annoying . . . . cents for a locker , and only half of them worked . the . thing didn t bother me , the fact that they weren t marked so you just kept throwing more quarters in there and hoping for the best , did . we strapped on our skates and took off . i haven t been in many years so it took me a few minutes to get comfortable . i can proudly say that i only fell once and it wasn t my fault . . . . . what i can not proudly say is that i ended up on top of a yr old boy . . . and from the very loud owwwuch that came out of him i m pretty sure i punched him in the balls . the look on his face was sheer horror . i still can t stop laughing about it . my date was pretty fancy on his feet . . . . . i half expected people to profess undying love to him and call out his name as we left . one dood kinda did all in all , one of the most fun filled evenings that i ve had in a long time . kudos great skate ! !

1,"the sushi was fresh and excellent ! the service was almost too fast . i did not find the prices to be out of line with the quality . our daughter loved the miso soup . the one thing i really appreciated is that they will make what you want , whether it is on the menu or not . if they have it , you can get it . i know we ll be going there often . one thing though , this is a busy , noisy place . it is not large either . if you are looking for quite and relaxed , this perhaps isn t the best choice . if you want good food in a noisy cheerful atmosphere , like a bunch of friends or after work , this fits the bill .

1,"amc esplanade is by far the most successful navigator of the new dinner and a movie blue ocean the theater industry is starting to penetrate that s right , i just referenced blue ocean strategy , get over it . no , it s not an extremely enlightened idea . i ve been sneaking bacardi into theaters since so it s about time theaters realize they should probably attempt to turn a profit off of it , but amc really upped the game by not only providing me the option of purchasing alcoholic beverages from them , but also upgraded chairs , and a ton of delicious food including the obligatory box of candy which is hilarious sitting next to a burger . like don t mind this full meal over here , we still stand firm that gummi bears are worth their weight in gold . yes , it s more expensive than a regular ticket . almost double for the nice seats . but trust me , you want those seats . you will regret not getting the seats if you don t buy the seats so just pony up the cash and delight in the fact that movie theaters are now almost as comfortable as watching a movie in your own home . this theater is so nice it even makes bad movies tolerable . i saw the master here and probably would have stabbed myself in the eye with my embezzled bacardi flask if i didn t have a comfy recliner and three glasses of wine to get me through it . i seriously won t go to a movie anywhere else and i guarantee you ll say the same once you go . five stars .

0,"it serves the purpose . that s about it . raging waters it is not . a smaller water park attached to a mini golf course it is . slides are fun . night splash is great no sun , bearable temperatures and no sun burn . i definitely would never go during the day . i couldn t imagine standing in line for hour with no shade , temps and broken misters i didn t see a functioning mister in the entire park . park could use a bit maintenance . staff could use a bit of training . lines were very disorganized . staff didn t have much of a clue as to what was going on . ex spent our last minutes waiting for the wave pool , getting into the wave pool and waiting about minutes only for the wave pool to never come on and for the park to close . losing almost a full hour out of the that night splash is open was a bit disappointing . i d probably still return . but only because there s nothing better in the valley .

1,"i ve come here too many times to count during my time at asu . each time i ve frequented this place , i ve pretty much inhaled whatever sandwich i got . i like the fact that you can customize your sandwich to order and i really like the fact that you get a little chocolate chip cookie for free with your order ! their jumbo cookies are pretty darn good too ! avoid this place during the lunch rush , as the queue can literally snake outside and around the building . prices may seem on the high side for just a sandwich , but the ingredients are fresh and the people behind the counter are generally cool . now . . . . to work on using non styrofoam cups . . . . let s make this place even better and greener !

0,sometimes the downside of yelp is that you read so many great reviews for a new restaurant and you garner these very high expectations . that s what happened with st . francis anyways . our bartender was not friendly at all . the dessert was very good however ! hopefully next time the service will be better sometimes you just catch people on an off night .

0,"this place is the perfect example of a tourist trap . nice location not far of the main drag of old scottsdale , beautiful building and layout . the margaritas are good , but probably more expensive than they ought to be for every one of the many styles . i thought paying for chips and salsa was a rip off , but then when the chips tasted stale , i was even less happy . c mon , if you have tortilla and factory in your name , you ought to have fresh chips . i thought the tortillas themselves were okay , not great , but okay . the carne fuego , or whatever i had the waitress recommended , was not good . small chunks of fire roasted steak completely ruined by a gloppy sweet hot sauce . the veggies that went with it were just okay and the sweet potato stuffed chile was weird . it could ve been great , but it was nowhere near good . unless your aunt hattie who has never had mexican food is in town from ohio , i d skip this place altogether .

1,"i am not as enthusiastic about the cornish pasty company as some , but if you are looking for this type of place to eat , you will probably enjoy the experience . a pasty is basically a turnover at cornish pasty company , it is a very big turnover . one is a meal . here they precook them until they are almost done , then finish them when you order . this process introduces a drying effect that detracts from the product . they do serve a sauce with each pasty , and as the sauces we tried were quite good , you can use the sauce to counteract the dryness . when all is said and done , the pastys are tasty . but not knock your socks off great . the atmosphere at cornish pasty company is cramped and noisy . it seems more like a college hangout than a restaurant , and this is not surprising because it is a college hangout , but one where the quality of the food has attracted a wider clientele . if you like this kind of atmosphere , you will be right at home at one of the few small tables or at the bar . i prefer the bar . prices are low typically about for a pasty , considering the size of the meal . hints . it is always crowded . try to come at an off hour , like on a weekday . . skip the very average salads and the oven chips dry , tasteless , and probably the other appetisers . just get a pasty . if you are an abnormally big eater , follow it up with a dessert pasty . . it is a bit hard to find . turn north on hardy from university to find the cornish pasty company in a small shopping center hidden by a large gas station .

0,"fine . just fine . c b average all around . the decor was rustic and lodge like , yet still open and modern . no complaints here aesthetically pleasing and lacking the bright colors and loud mariachi music of more traditional mexican restaurants . the table we were sat at seemed to have been haphazardly wiped not totally clean . our server was okay as well friendly enough , but seemed generally disinterested in her job and us and was not very knowledgable about the food she was serving . the food was fine . the salsa served with the chips was totally fine fresh enough but not very flavorful a theme we would soon learn would repeat itself throughout our dining experience . we started with the avocado egg rolls with cilantro honey dipping sauce . these were the highlight of the meal the sweet sauce complimented the creamy avocado taste nicely . my only qualm here was the . price tag for standard sized egg rolls . seems a wee bit steep for what it was , but still very tasty . i ordered the vegetarian tacos and they were good not wow , but good . i appreciated the variety of vegetables and the fact that they had veggie tacos in the first place many more standard mexican restaurants do not . i do wish they d had more spices . the side of rice was pretty good , but not as flavorful as i d like . the veggie tacos are also served with some sort of pickled cabbage onion slaw because the borracho beans that accompany the other dishes are cooked with bacon . the slaw was also fine . in general the food was acceptable , but a bit bland . i should also mention that the portions are quite reasonable two smallish veggie tacos and a bit of rice and slaw . sometimes the portions as more traditional mexican restaurants are absurdly gargantuan it was nice to see a normal sized and relatively healthy seeming mexican ish meal . full disclosure here our visit to black chile was prompted by a card we d received in the mail good for off any meal . so we figured it was worth a shot and it was , but maybe not a return visit . our bill pre discount for the appetizer , entrees , and two sodas came to . if it wasn t at the biltmore , i d say it was a little steep , but considering its location , it s probably right on . i d go back if the food had wowed me , especially since it s in my neighborhood , but it didn t , so a repeat visit isn t likely . there are enough solidly and star places in the vicinity that stars doesn t generally make me a repeat customer .

1,"i was reluctant to try this shop at first . some of the reviews that popped up via google lead me to believe it unpleasant and not well stocked . well , you can fool some of the people some of the time , and today , i was no longer fooled by whatever weird people out there have it in for double joy beads . firstly , their czech seed beads are the cheapest in town . i m not even kidding . i purchased six half tubes and one full for around . the organization thereof leaves something to be desired , but at those prices , browsing should be a joy . their pressed glass and fire polished selections were of average number and price . in the swavorski department , standard bicones , cubes and rounds are not available as singles only some of the pendant materials , and even then , some come packed two to a bag . i was a bit vexed by this . what if someone wants one baroque for a pendant ? the back sported a nice assortment of findings and stringing materials . particularly impressive a display of natural copper items ready for raiding . sales bins occupied the front some bags currently up for less than a quarter . i found the clerk on duty during my visit was more of the hands off type , but quite personable when i checked out . the store itself is a bit hard to find , tucked in a winding strip mall . it s directly across the street from arizona art supply . that street is scottsdale road , but if you can see the art store from the side where double joy abides , you can t be far .

1,"i had an amazing dinner tonight at quiessence . when we made the reservation they asked if we were celebrating anything we were , so when we sat down we were given glasses of complimentary champagne . we started with a plate of three delicious cheeses . they have a huge selection of cheeses , probably about , and we chose a goat , a smoked gouda and a jack . all delicious and served with crostini , perfectly melt in your mouth bartlett pears , pecans , honey and quince paste . great start . our next course we shared two salads an octopus carpaccio and field green salad . both good . my main course was amazing . it was heritage turkey with mashed potatoes and carrots . i ate every bite . so flavorful . my dad had a beef sirloin that was perfectly cooked and delicious with a side of fingerling potatoes . my mom got swordfish . it was not cooked properly when it first came out , but they promptly corrected the problem , so i can t fault them for that . the ambience was great including a live but not distracting singer and a warm crackling fireplace . in addition , i want to give big props to the servers for knowing everything about the food they served . she knew where the fish was caught , how the beef was raised , what certifications the turkey farm had achieved . it is great to be able to get those kind of answers with zero attitude when you ask the question . my only reservations would be definitely is slow food , maybe a tad too slow but so delicious it was worth it and they said they were short staffed and i m not sure i buy that their seafood is sustainable . they served atlantic cod and atlantic swordfish . my understanding is that both of these fish stocks are pretty severely depleted . i asked and was told that the fisherman they buy from are committed to sustainable methods , but i m not sure personally , for me , at least that it is possible to sustainably fish a stock that is in danger . all in all though , a fantastic night and i can t wait to return !

1,"tried bombay spice last night . after reading the website and reviews , it seemed like it would fit perfectly our combined need to finally find good indian fare in phoenix and not blow our calorie budget husband and i are trying and succeeding ! in losing weight . success on both counts ! it was saturday at about and we were seated immediately . the place was almost full . we sat on the patio , which was lovely , but might get too hot during the summer i didn t see any misters you re welcome , mother earth ! . service was attentive , and our waitress gave us several recommendations . we ordered somosas baked , i think , not fried , which made them a little messier to eat but still very very tasty . naan chewy , moist , naan y . . . yum grilled shrimp skewers a little on the skimpy side , but very tasty , and served with grilled peppers and onions and a delightful mint sauce . we each ordered individual entrees with basmati . they encourage you to order the two entree choice , but we were trying to avoid over ordering , and it turned out to be exactly the right amount of food . i ordered the cauliflower and potatoes , which was moist , savory , a little spicy , and very tasty , albeit lacking a little in the sauce department i would have liked a little something to spoon over my rice . husband ordered the chicken tikka masala , which was exceptional . they claim that they don t use cream in their food , so i don t know how they made the masala sauce so creamy and good , but they did and i m not going to question it any more ! i would have licked the bowl if we had been at home . next time i think we ll get some apps again but try the bombay plate to share , which is entree choices and rice . that way we can try a whole bunch of things . before tip for naan , two appetizers , and two single choice entrees . not bad for a saturday out . we ll definitely be back , even though it was kind of a drive for us .

1,"stopped in for lunch with an old friend . we had lots to catch up on , so got a booth inside where it was quieter . the decor is true to tom s heritage at this location , modernized with lots of historical pics on the wall . the governor s room has an attractive gleaming golden state seal over the doorway . service was excellent . food was ok . great bar with tom s specialties , where i don t water , so no info on that . i should have had the chili , or a burger to really try the food . i had a cuban sandwich with house salad instead . the salad greens were fresh , the tiny tom atoes sweet and crunchy . the sandwich was a phoenix arizona cuban sandwich from tom s tavern , not like a cuban sandwich made by somebody s cuban mother or abuelo using all the right cuban ingredients . kind of like mexican food in yellowknife , yukon territory . good test . next time i m having the burger . there will be a next time . ambiance service cleanliness cuban sandwich "

0,"i ve lived near old town scottsdale for years and in all that time i ve never really taken to the streets by foot , aside from a weekly visit to the farmers market . at first glance you ask yourself how many indian jewelry shops can the area possibly sustain ? well the answer is , the turquoise market in old town seems to be doing quite well . so it was on a recent exploration trip that we happened upon david s hamburger s and mexican food . so for me the idea of killer burger and tasty mexican good is a match made in heaven , were talking major food groups here . tucked between galleries , david s is a blink and you ll miss it kind of place , very unassuming and humble . inside you won t be wowed by the interior design but what they do have is functional and comfortable . with tv s at both ends of the hall like space , you ll be entertained by performance videos of s era rock n roll . i usually don t write much about soda pop , well never , but in this case the cherry coke . was kind of special . when you order a coke you can ask them to add a number of different flavorings from lemon and vanilla to chocolate and of course cherry . david s version is wonderfully fizzy and cuts through the richness of the upcoming meal . of all the ways mexican style meat is prepared , the grilled taste of beef is my all time favorite . if you enjoy this as much as i do then id suggest the carne asada nachos . . a massive pile of crunchy tortilla chips is covered in grilled beef strips , melted cheese , guacamole , sour cream and pico de gallo . while basic , i ate most of them myself leaving my partner to scraping the cheese off of the plate . if you d like salsa on your chips , be sure to ask them to bring you bowls of green and red salsa . now who doesn t like a big juicy hamburger ? david s doesn t disappoint with david s single . , say that times fast . a lb patty topped with the usual suspects , then dressed with david s creamy sauce which to me was a thick version of thousand isle dressing , adding a layer of tangy goodness . along side you have your choice of fries or you can choose to upgrade . to a mix of large deep fried onion rings and golden french fries . for dipping i a side of david s sauce did the trick in lieu of ketchup . the patty melt . is classic diner food . we re talking thick ground beef patty , melted cheese and grilled onions on your choice of grilled sourdough or rye bread . the wholesome grease from the beef patty and grilled onions is absorbed into the bread creating a creamy like texture , for me this is what a patty melt is all about . of course the guacamole burger . with its pepper jack cheese , bacon and guacamole is the marriage of mexican and american influence . if you re an early riser , david s also serves breakfast like bacon pancakes . and coconut waffles . . someone please pass the syrup . my only question , where is the breakfast burrito ?

1,"my husband i are addicted to cherryblossom s ramen . mr . t is japanese i lived in japan for years , so take my word it s authentic . the mix of foods is not so strange if you re familiar with restaurants in japan . the ramen is hakata style , made with a pork broth may be heavy oily for some people , so why not please everybody ? be sure to ask for cha shu ramen to get a few more pieces of pork . extra the salads are also fantastic warm lightly fried ? shrimp on a fresh spring mix base with mango dressing , shanghai duck salad , and the chicken caesar was perfect , not heavily dressed like some roadhouses . mr . t our daughter loved the eggplant in miso sauce , even the california roll was good . it s said japan took the best of each country s cuisine . so there are french pastries , german beer , italian pasta , and indian curries . save the banana bread for dessert if you can , or get one of their pastries . i ve never have enough room . if you like good white bread , buy one of the pullman loaves on the table by the front door . my first extra pounds in japan came from the good bread ! no whole grain breads were available years ago ! i think it s too small for groups over six . maybe we ll see you there . added i think that their menus are not all alike , so if ramen isn t on the menu you receive , you can still order it . it s posted in japanese on the wall . for the basic , ask for hakata ramen . for extra pork , ask for cha shu men or cha shu ramen . either way , there s really not much pork in it . that s why you need a delicious shrimp or duck salad .

1,the castle is what drew us here . it s just the front of a castle with a reading nook in the bottom of the tower . the year old was impressed as soon as he saw it . there is also a play area with big activity walls . it was a little hard for my son to comprehend being quiet while playing . getting to the library was confusing with the gps . just follow the signs and park in the garage at the end to the left when you pull in . well worth a one time visit .

1,"had a fabulous time here with my husband celebrating my birthday last weekend . we both got the farmer s feast and it was truly amazing . i was not expecting that we would each get unique dishes so that let us sample even more of the food though the hubby didn t really share too much . i highly recommend this option for anyone dining here . the antipasti was a great selection of cured meats and local cheeses . next , i had a wonderful salad that was a great combination of sharp peppery flavors mixed with sweet . strawberries , arugula , radishes , yum ! for pasta course i got gnocchi with a rich and tasty cream sauce and my husband got ravioli stuffed with yam . his dish was amazing , i had to fight for a couple bites . for the fish course i had poached halibut that was served with some kind of really flavorful sauce and a vegetable puree so that whole thing was extremely delicious . the hubby got a very lightly seared tuna fillet . i was very surprised that he enjoyed it so much since he is usually not a raw fish kind of guy . for our main course i got a pork tenderloin and the hubby got braised beef . . . just lucky we each got our favorite meats . each came with other vegetables and starches on the plate so they would have been an ample meal in and of themselves . for dessert , i got a goat cheese cheesecake that was truly amazing . one of the best deserts i have ever eaten . very rich but the pieces were small enough so that it was not heavy . the dessert did not have too much sweetness so it went well with the ice wine it was served with which tasted like pure honey . just fantastic . the hubby got bread pudding which we didn t much care for and it came with a sorbet that i didn t try . i got the wine pairings with the meal and every wine just complimented the dish it was served with so beautifully that i was really glad i added that option . also , it ended up that you got a half glass at least with each course so i think it is a good value the wine pairing was an extra . i do agree with a couple of the reviewers who mentioned salt . there were a couple of dishes that had just a tad too much . however , i think that was not due to a mistake of the chef , i believe it is just because they use cured meats in a lot of their dishes . another reviewer mentioned bad service but we did not experience that at all . our server was extremely warm and friendly . she was very knowledgeable on the food and could answer any questions we had for her . she also took the time for each course to explain each dish and in my case the wine and why they went together . only one time did my wine not come out at the same time with the food course and in that case our server apologized immediately . i do agree with some of the reviewers that the service is very slow . . . however , i believe that this is intentional . they have created a very cozy and comfortable environment and they want you to linger and enjoy yourself . with the farmer s feast in particular it took us almost hours start to finish but i enjoyed every minute of it . it was nice to have time in between courses to sit and talk and relax . the spacing also kept us from feeling too full by the end it is six courses after all ! or from letting the flavors from one dish influence the next . i was able to enjoy each course separately and independently with its own unique wine . it was pure food heaven . this is not the type of place where you would stop in for a meal before a show or event when you come here , this should be your only destination for the night and it is such a great experience that it will be enough ! we truly had fantastic night here . one warning i will say is for ladies , you need to be prepared for the rural atmosphere and the walk from the car to the restaurant would be challenging in heels i had been warned so had wedges . in fact the dress code overall was a bit more casual than i was expecting . kai at wildhorse pass resort is my absolute favorite special occasion restaurant and so we were making a lot of comparisons between the two . my husband made the comment that when we were at kai we spoke in library whispers the whole time and felt a little awkward at times you know the type of place where you feel like if you use the wrong fork you may end up getting kicked out but at quiessence we were chatting away the whole time and completely at ease . it is definitely a much more comfortable and relaxed environment then any other i have experienced at a restaurant of this caliber .

0," no . if you ask me about eating at papaya thai , that is what i will say . stars for the single kinda scattered and scruffy staffperson . stars for the cook who cannot prepare an offering from the menu as the menu describes it . in this case , i was down to two remaining untried thai restaurants within quick reach of the valley metro limo , and both in tempe . the other half was in tampa , and since he does not care much for thai , i get the chance to try one . the limo arrived at southern and mill at pm , and connected me with another limo at broadway . with traffic , getting to mcclintock took nearly minutes . on exiting the limo , pm , i walked back about half a block to the restaurant . on entering the restaurant , i picked up a menu and rang the bell and a somewhat harried staff person came to greet me . he asked me where i wanted to sit , at a table with bench looking directly into the side of a huge fish tank . . . or the next table , which would leave no buffer between myself and the only other table seated in the restaurant . there are at least seats in this restaurant . why so fiercely contain people in the first three tables close to the door ? you must get your business in fits and hurries and keeping only the tables active is working for you ? then again , your telling me you are the only staffperson does not surprise me . the help wanted sign on the door was more than an indication that help is needed ! when i was seated , staffperson offered to bring water . the phone rang and he was off , as he offered another version of i am the only staffperson here . . . i looked at the menu and made my decision . in the menu , there is a charge listed for sharing . this goes against everything thai i have ever known . the traditional thai meal has everyone enjoying some of each dish served . because of my proximity to the fish tank , i was quite up close and personal with the fish . the water probably isn t filthy , but the plexiglass tank is not helping the perception . pm , as the cellphone chime reminds me of the passing of an hour . i am waiting for water and a staffperson who can take my order . , the staffperson comes , bearing a pitcher of water and a my eyes are rolling in opposite directions because i am either overworked or stoned smile . he filled up my glass and asked if i was ready to order . i replied that i was and ordered som tom , the thai name for the green papaya salad . staffperson replied that he did not know the thai names for the menu items . the phone rang again . staffperson s attention was no longer on me . the phone , his pavlovian stimuli , had taken him away . i asked if he had heard me . he replied that he needed to go answer the phone . he asked if i minded waiting , as he was the only staffperson . i said i would wait . off he went , in pursuit of electronic interaction . pm , staffperson returns , apologizing for the telephone delay and asking about my order . i ordered the papaya salad without the green beans and steamed rice on the side . staffperson took the order and went to the kitchen . the phone rang as he left the table , his pace quickening as he approached the phone . pm , the door opens and potential patrons enter . the bell rings and staffperson rushes to the waitstand to greet new patrons . pm , staffperson returns . he brings the salad and a bowl of rice . the salad that appears has some of the traditional salad ingredients along with ingredients that have no business being in the salad . som tom does not have cucumber , shredded lettuce or cilantro . on sending back the initial preparation , staffperson returned with the original preparation , advising the chef stated this is a traditional thai presentation of the dish . i sent the order back , citing the inconsistencies and asking for a new presentation . pm . as i empty my water glass , the salad i received previously is returned , minus the cucumber . in asking staffperson if this is a new presentation or if it is an attempt to correct the original , he replied that he did not know . i stood and left . while the advertisement on the window of the establishment says they have the best curry in the valley , they will get no second chance to prove it to me . for all the phone activity , there was no one who came to pick up a carry out order . between this and the somewhat glazed staffperson , i have to wonder if this place is not a front for a drug business .

1,we went there right before my grandma s th birthday . there were about of us . the place was busy but we called ahead and they put our name in even though we still didn t have a final count of people . the place was busy but i know why . everyone had a different dish and we all loved it . everyone wanted to taste each others food because we all liked it so much . we all seem to think we are food critics and we loved this place . extensive menu and they seemed to nail everything we had ! the staff was amazing and would go back in a heartbeat !

1,"finally made my way to the new lolo s in scottsdale . live close by and really haven t heard of it until about a month ago when i was renting a video at blockbuster . decided to go fairly late saturday before they closed and at about pm the place was pretty packed . was given a choice to sit at the bar which wasn t a problem . impressed by the transformation as this location used to have a tokyo express which i would go to at least once a week . i was joined at the bar by other people and given menus . only issues i have with my whole meal is that they should have decided the bar so that people can put their legs underneath because the meal required a bit of gymnastics to fit comfortably . other issue , but one i can forgive is that the people next to me were asked what they wanted to drink , koolaid , and somehow i became temporarily invisible and wasn t . took about minutes for anyone to bother to ask . i can t blame though because the place was busy and i who doesn t want a new place to be successful when the food and atmosphere are good . ordered the betty boop chicken and waffle , and so did the other people next to me . . . i have that effect on people . chicken breast and waffle were delicious and i definitely had a sugar high from the gallons of koolaid that were served to me . i ll make a note to maybe go for some diet coke next time . definitely recommend the place and hope to check it out with my family or a group of friends to have better seating .

0,scuzy waiter . scuzy manager . overall just a bad experience . the food was pretty awful too . i don t understand how this place is so successful ! the food was either waaaay over seasoned of severely under seasoned . a hole in the wall chinese restaurant can produce better chinese food . and at cheaper prices . search around . it ll be well worth it .

1,"citizen public house is a great addition to the old town dining scene . i love seeing restaurants crop up in that part of town that aren t just catering to the bar scene and making the food an afterthought . my girlfriend and i made reservations for friday night expecting bernie kantak s new restaurant to be packed . much to our surprise when we arrived , the place was pretty dead with tons of open tables . we purposely arrived early to enjoy a cocktail at the bar and even though we could have been seated right away , we pressed forward with our original plan . at the bar , i ordered my usual cocktail while the gf ordered a sangria off their cocktail menu . we also ordered an order of the bacon fat heirloom popcorn from the bar snacks menu . my cocktail was perfectly made and my gf loved the sangria . the popcorn took forever to come out , but when it was delivered they also brought out an order of the calamari compliments of the chef . the popcorn was a little bit burned and we both thought it could have used some salt , which was surprising since we thought the bacon fat would have provided that flavor . the calamari was perfectly cooked and not greasy in the least . i enjoyed the pickled fennel on the side , but my gf isn t a fan of fennel , so she didn t try it . after we finished our cocktails at the bar , we moved to a table for the main event . in an unusual move for us , we skipped wine and stuck with beer and cocktails , but i did eye some good finds on the concise wine list . for our appetizer , we ordered the sausage of the day , which was a beef based sausage with a cabbage casing . it was very unique and we both really enjoyed it . for our main courses , the gf ordered the az b . l . t . and ordered the pork tender loin . the b . l . t . had tons of perfectly crispy bacon on it , but we both agreed that it was really good , but not great overall . the pork tender loin , on the other hand , was excellent in my opinion . i loved the figs and the sweet potato chevre strudel . of course , you could put chevre on anything and i would like it . when it was time for dessert , we knew that we had to try some of tracy dempsey s latest creations . we normally split dessert , but decided to each get our own . the gf got the cookies and milk and i had the chocolate toffee bread pudding . the cookies are delivered in a bag that you can take home , which is great because you probably won t down the generous serving of cookies in one setting unless you re sharing . my gf was quite happy to take home a little bag of cookies to enjoy later . my bread pudding was awesome and i wish i could have purchased a gallon of the maker s mark ice cream to take home with me . i ll definitely be craving this dessert in the future . the atmosphere of the restaurant is a little austere , even for my taste . it just seems like they could a little bit to make it a little bit more warm and inviting . service , while extremely friendly , was a little bit uneven throughout the night starting with the snacks at the bar taking a long time and continuing with confusion over what tables plates should be delivered to . keep in mind the restaurant has been open for only a week , so these are things that can be worked out . we were really surprised to see the restaurant so empty on a friday night , so i hope more people give it a try . citizen is a really good neighborhood restaurant that has the potential to be great . we look forward to trying it again to see how it improves and evolves . i m really hoping it s a successful staple in old town for years to come .

1,"this is my favorite sushi spot in phoenix . i see sushi chefs from other restaurants coming here to eat during their off time . the prices are very reasonable , and all of the rolls and sashimi are very fresh and crafted to perfection by the old timers . the ramen noodle bowl is awesome , and nothing like what you would buy in the grocery store . it is topped with pork , fish cake , bamboo , and seaweed . i highly recommend . they even have a fried salmon skin roll , which was very flavorful and not always available at every establishment . i wish that i would have taken a picture of the last one that i purchased , it was absolutely perfect . they also offer takoyaki , which is like an octopus dumpling ball . you would have no idea that it contained octopus unless you were familiar with the dish . these are absolutely amazing and highly addictive . you have to try these during your visit . the last time that i was there , i had to try the ichigo mochi ice cream . it was green tea ice cream , surrounded by a rice flour shell and topped with whipped cream . it really hit the spot and i was so full but in a happy and satisfying way . if you like sushi , and you think that ra is cool , hit yourself on the head for being a complete fool and go check this place out and get schooled on what fresh authentic sushi is all about . your mouth will thank you for doing the right thing ! cheers and keep up the good work at the place . fyi . . . bring your own saki if you need booze with your meal . i say , just enjoy the good meal without alcohol and see how happy and relaxed the meal makes you feel .

0,"growing up near this little hole in the wall , this place was a constant stop for my family . it s really good , greasy chinese food that basically tastes like you would expect it to . now that i live farther away i still have cravings for their delicious orange chicken and chicken fried rice . if you re nearby during lunch try out a lunch special , really great prices !

1,"i love going to this store whether its for just for the latest copy of guitar world , some strings , or a new guitar , the guy johnny is my main man lol he always gives me good deals and generally makes me and any one else i take there feel like we are the only customers , in a good way ! every one remembers you and asks you how your day is going great mom and pop feel .

0,"i got strikes at verde , hence . . . i m out ! strike not very vegetarian friendly . strike they have all the necessary items to make nachos , but when asked if they would make me nachos i got a very quick and blunt no . strike when forced to order a meat dish and request they not include the meat the most expensive ingredient not only did they make no attempt to substitute the meat with maybe beans , or guac , or extra cheese , they still charged full price ! i don t want to eat meat and i sure don t want to pay for it . and as far as the food , well , they got that part right , for a place that serves fine fast food , when you ask me how my meal was , my response would be fine . "
1,"step back in time ! every once in awhile you start to look for something different for lunch and then pops up a place like macalpines . besides the great s atmosphere and good food , this place will have you smiling and reminicing the moment you step into the door ! i am not downtown that often but rest assured , i will be back to this place .

1,how could you write a bad review about a mountain ? great sight to see . 
0,"old town scottsdale has a personality disorder . it tries to be one thing during the day and another at night . merchants are gouged for hellish fees in order to provide the free parking so prices reflect this big gouge as some have to make up six figures per year no joke . during the day old town caters to the typical tourists with skin that hasn t seen the sun since eisenhower was president . the little shops sell a combination of crap and genuine goods . restaurants cater to the over crowd for lunch and the idea is to keep people milling around until they have spent all of their money . the perimeter of old town is alive with baseball , a hospital , banks and other real world establishments . at night the clubs open and each one thinks it s the viper room or the abbey . sorry , this isn t la . high cover charges for lame , watered drinks and dead ambiance won t cut it . they make up for being dull with loud music . the rooftop bar concept seems to be dying off after locals who can t sleep through the racket take a few shots at the places from time to time . i can t blame them . a mile away the noise from these places is still thumping loud . it must be horrific to be at one of those rooftop bars . but to be fair , arizona is not known for night life . it s a place where the sidewalks are rolled up at dusk and they try to cash in on big events like the occasional super bowl . they also try to create a night scene studio style with a new hot place popping up and when it is no longer trendy , they change the name and it becomes something else . restaurants in old town also change names in the summer in hope of fleecing the same crowd the next tourist season . many are now corporate owned and the local restaurants have had no choice but to follow the downward spiral . on the up side , look for the local bars and by that i don t mean clubs . the bars such as the blue moose are locally owned and serve up good food at decent prices , good drinks and offer friendly service . stay away from the per entree places and just go cheap and have a good time . if you are the sort who likes to drop on a well drink with a bunch of plastic people who are keeping up appearances with the last of their visa credit line , az is the place to go .

0,good to know they still have independent films and they chose wisely what to play . unfortunately this location seems to be attracting yuppies ! i was shocked to see how many middle aged and even elderly were at camelview . that was a disappointment 
0,this place is pretty good . better than average but not great . fish fry on fridays is ok if you like deep battered fish . nice atmosphere lots of tv s . uquiel beer on tap
1,i was really pleased with bombay spice . . it s definitely not your typical indian restaurant setting . . think more contemporary american decor . . . i mean the smiths were playing on the stereo which gave it a nice relaxing casual vibe . we were served by a great friendly waitress who really knew the food and explained everything real well . . you can tell she was very excited about it . we started with the appetizer sampler which had four selections of appetizers of your choosing . . all were outstanding especially the wings and the chickpea ceviche . i then tried the chicken tikka masala which had lots of great flavor and a nice kick then we checked in on yelp and got a free dessert . great prices and the way you order the food makes it really simple . . great little casual place tucked away in the corner of a strip mall near pv mall . 
0,"ok so the look of the portions in the pictures are very deceptive . the waffle and pancakes arent big as they look , however i am stuffed so i guess the waffle was big enough . the food was very good , i thought it would be better , but i am not disappointed . i would come back here the waffle was not as good as the farm and the pancakes were not as good as first watch . but thats just my opinion . next time i want to try some of their scrambles . "
0,"good prices but this please is honestly not worth the hassle . first of all you have to leave your purse at the counter . i am not comfortable doing that anywhere . who does that ? the only place i have ever seen this before was asu s bookstore . then you walk in this warehouse that has no air conditioning ! ! ! i made the mistake of going yesterday in the middle of the day degrees out , yikes ! then you get inside and you have to carry a catalog to refer to for prices since items are unmarked in large boxes . if they had a c it would have been worth it to save a few bucks on the toys my dog destroys in minutes but no air conditioning ? ? ? in arizona ? ? madness ! "
1,"oh orange table , what can i say about you ? i am , to say the least , a regular here . completely by default , of course , given that i work directly over this great little coffee shop . the food here amazing . the coffee the best . the atmosphere perfect . so why only four stars ? because the service can be absolutely abysmal at times . given , there are a few star performers here who give it their all , bust their ass , and never forget a customer s name . and sue , the owner , really seems to genuinely care about each and every person that walks in the door . but the service is so unwaveringly slow that i am often prevented from eating here due to time constraints . example i once ordered a cup of soup to go soup , mind you , that is completely ready and cooked , just sitting in a big tureen in the back and it took minutes . so , yes , the food is amazingly fresh , inventive , delectable . the prosciutto is shipped in from italy . the bread is natural and baked locally . the chef s in the kitchen are mad geniuses , whipping up sandwiches , salads , appetizers , all completely fresh and filling . but you absolutely must have the time to wait for it . i ve never had anything i didn t like ! "
1,we had a great meal here ! i started with the cheap salad as i was craving salad . hit the spot . hubby started with smashed irishman drink and loved . he moved onto a draft beer . i moved onto fish and chips they were light and just the right size . hubby had beef stroganoff he said it was tasty . we ended with the fabulous salted caramel my fav thing of the night . i think the bill was before tip pretty reasonable to me . 
1,"this place is great ! i need an adjustment every now and then but i live in scottsdale and my regular chiropractor is so good that he is always booked up ahead of time , so if i tweek my back unexpectedly i can t get in soon enough quite often . so . . now i have a place to go seven days a week that is every bit as good as my normal chiro . i have only gone to the weekend chiro but my wife and one of my employees have seen dr . brian and they love him . so if you need a good chiro . . . go see these guys any day of the week . try em you ll love em !

1,"this restaurant is close to my office , so it is a regular stop for either a great mexican breakfast or lunch . never been dissapointed , nor have any of my co workers . try the huevos rancheros or the chiliquiles with the green sauce , it is a favorite . "
1,"wow what a fun little antique , etc . store i stumbled across the other day ! i stopped in at the starbucks for a refresher and noticed all of this funky stuff out in front of the store ! i went inside and it was a combination of an th century hardware store and art walk . there was just a little bit of everything some vintage , shabby chic , crystal door pulls industrial toys . the owners are great and are going to help me find a little period table i ve been searching for . lot of great accents ! i m hooked ! i ll be back with a vengence !

0,it s the kinda place where you re certain the employees don t spit in your food . best taco bell i ve been to . 
0,"i wasn t sure what to expect . this was stop on the pub crawl . there was an emo looking couple in a booth a table full of patrons they looked like regulars the artwork on the walls was dark and ecclectic , but the place didn t have a dark feel . i can t say this would be my bar . but if i were in the neighborhood i would go to this bar for a few drinks and some hummus .

0,very nice location but food was awful . had a chicken salad yuck . service stunk big time ! 
1,"love this place pretty decent sushi for a good price , i love that they have happy hour and reverse happy hour . they re even open till am for when i m craving sushi for a midnight meal only reason i gave it stars is that the service is slow sometimes"
1,"i must say that this place was nothing like i expected when i read that we finally had an authentic parisian patisserie in the valley , owned by two real parisians ! i envisioned a warm , casual shop with fresh croissants , danishes , cakes , etc . like the places i experienced in paris . needless to say my expectations were way off i should have been thinking less mom and pop paris bake shop and more payard patisserie , with delicate pastry works of art in a stark , hip space . we shared two desserts , a blueberry something or other and a lemon tart , and both were fantastic ! so while it s a little more upscale th arrondissement than casual th , it s still authentic paris in scottsdale , and who doesn t love that ? ! "
1,"i ld give stars if possible for each and every appetizer we have had . the tomato soup , caesar salad , beignets , and crab dip are all way more delicious than they have any right to be . however , the stand out is clearly the shrimp canap one of the best appetizers i ve ever had . period . the other side of the coin is the at best mediocre entrees . the first night we had a gift certificate and ordered an absurd amount of food and ended up leaving both the burger and meatloaf largely untouched . on subsequent visits the appetizers were consistently amazing and the variety of entrees just didn t live up to the apps . the blackened tacos were bland and tasteless . the meatloaf was swimming in liquid . the burger bun was overly toothsome and the burger bland . long story short order appetizers which there are more than enough of and you will be happy . also happy hour is great but the wine is overpriced otherwise . take away worth it for shrimp canap if nothing else ! "
1,"had a wonderful birthday dinner at cibo last night . this was about the rd or th time visiting this quaint house turned restaurant , and now is the time to yelp . cibo has wonderful appetizer of antipasti that played with my taste buds ! fun to make your own brushettas . . . . my husband and i shared the rustica delightful , delicious , delectable . . . . and the creps . . . what can i say . . . i didn t need it , but i wanted it , so i had it , so there ! fresca creps with fruit , vanilla ice cream and fresh whip . . . . mmmm . . . food coma . lovely service and birthday !

0,"it was an ok gyro for almost twice as much as the other places i ve been to . it had a ridiculous amount of mutton sausage that s what gyro meat is , fwiw , and was pretty tasty , but not as good as a gyro at ali baba . the price you pay for location , i guess . this would have gotten three stars , but then it gave me indigestion all day and i couldn t eat dinner , so it loses some for that .

0,after moving back to the area from cali i needed somewhere to get my acrylics done . i usually like to get some kind of design or unique tips . after walking in i saw some tips i liked so i decided to try out this place . the first visit was bad the nail tech would not listen to the length of nails i was requesting and did a terrible job at shaping them . i always give people more than one chance so i went back and this time i got a pedicure first then the nail tech left the salon and i sat near the dryer for min before approaching the manager about the length of time i had been waiting for a fill . he replied unapologetically that the tech had to leave to pick up her son from school . . . i sat another min before i was seen by someone else . they also did a poor job . i will not spend my money somewhere that they do not value their customers . not to mention they did a crap job and were overpriced when it came to designs and tips with prints on them . don t waste your time here . 
1,"yummy in my tummy goes the won ton soup . it is my go to for when anyone is feeling sick and totally hits the spot with all its veggies . best in the valley , imho . the fried rice is also really yummy here . they don t skimp on the veggies which i love . last visit to eat in was a couple weeks ago and the waitress owner ? was super nice to us and our french friends visiting from across the pond . i will definitely make an effort to eat in more often instead of ordering out .

0,why can t the attendant understand a simple direct question ? can someone please tell me just where the hell i m supposed to put my freakin drink ? and worst of all . . . my balls don t fit in this place . one extra star for the bartender offering me her personal lighter minus the extra star for not having any matches
1,"fantastic little lunch brunch spot ! went here with the family while visiting scottsdale and really enjoyed it ! we had the tuna melt , which was delicious with their spiked cottage cheese ! the cranberry chicken salad made into a sandwich was delicious ! the omelets and scrambles looks great i didn t taste , but then again , there was nothing left on the plate ! lol smaller place so could be busy during peak hours , may call or try and hit an off time . service was ok , wasn t anything special but the food was really cute and made for a really cute little lunch spot !

0,"still a place that is unacceptable in my book especially when a server there goes out of their way to message me privately on yelp to complain about my punctuation , and signing off every so sincerely i might add , with love the b tchy waitress from az . way to keep it classy over there . . . . .

0,"walked in during late lunch hour . did not get acknowledged for about mins . when i finally got sat down , and served my salad , i found a hair in it . got no apology . just a sigh firm the waitress when she took it away . you can t pay me to go back here . the waiters are rude . "
1,"this place is everything a sports bar should be . lots and lots of tv s . . . for one . i love being able to watch different sports and play trivia all at the same time . the drink specials are pretty decent . they re not a dollar or anything , but the big beers are cheap on happy hour . the food is great ! so far i ve only tried the spinach dip , wings and their all you can eat fish chips . all of them were seriously delicious ! these types of food are pretty standard in sports bars but i ve definitely had my fair share of unfortunate food items from other places . these certainly surpassed my expectations . and last but not least , their star of the show , debbie . one of the best bartenders i ve ever seen . she runs that bar like a champ , knows nearly every face that walks through that door , and pours great drinks . and by great , i mean a good stiff drink that s not so strong that you can t taste anything else in it . we frequent this place quite often , and for good reason . do yourself a favor and stop in !

1,"i actually love the waterfront grill . i have never been there during bar hours , so it might not be a good later in the evening , but i usually go around for dinner and the food has always been excellent . i usually get the buffalo chicken wrap , but sometimes i go with the fish tacos . both are excellent and the service is great because usually my and my friend are the only ones in there i often wonders how it stays open . the cookie desert is awesome ! it is like the piezooki and oregano s . just as good .

0,"i was disappointed too . i waited an hour and then took at seat at the counter which is ok with me , but if you ve got long legs your only option is to sit spread eagled in order to get close enough to your plate and there s not that much legroom to each side . in the small space in front of the counter the staff was in perpetual motion squeezing past each other to get drinks , etc . my cheddar , jalepeno , sausage omelette was very good , but not huge , and the hash browns were crisp and tasty on the outside but soggy on the inside . the whole wheat toast was great , but no choice of toppings . . . i was given a small dollop of peach preserves . the waffles next to me looked fabulous , but i m not a fan . basically i didn t think it wasn t worth the hour wait in degrees and i was relieved to get outside where there was some breathing room .

1,"i love their bruschetta . i get weird cravings for it and have to eat it at least once a month . i ve always had friendly servers , although they can be slow with getting the food out . i was here last saturday morning and the man next to me walked out without eating because first his order got lost and never sent to the kitchen . then when they finally took his order they still made him wait a long time for his food . that was probably just a mistake all around , but i felt bad for the guy .

1,"this place confirms why hole in the wall places are the best places to get food . its virtually impossible to find the place but once you smell the aroma of home cooked mexican food , you know that you re there . usually there is a long line however , their service is quick . with the combination of their swift service and decadently savory food , rito s is a staple mexican food stand that everyone has to visit when in phoenix . i always have a green chilli burrito and haven t quite ventured out to other things on their menu , but i have never heard anything less than positive about what they have to offer . "
0,"another disappointed visit . i am starting to think this isn t a fluke and pb has lost it s magic touch . we went for my wife s birthday around pm on a wednesday . we actually walked right in and sat down . we were both shocked as the least amount of time we have ever waited was well over hours . the staff was more attentive on where we sat than giving us a genuine greeting even though the place was empty except two other tables . we put in our order for a margherita with prosciutto , a wise guy , and a caprese salad . the bread came out cold with some oil to dip it in . i can t remember if it was always cold but it would be nice if they threw it in the oven for seconds before they serve it to you . next our pizzas came out and the margherita was missing the prosciutto . not a big deal . maybe he didn t hear me , maybe the cook didn t hear him ? my wife confirms i did request it and i m not losing my mind . the pizzas were good but lacking the usual special touch . the crust was the best part which is not unusual but what was unusual was the rest was very lack luster . even though the shop was dead our waiter never came back to us and was back behind the bar laughing and chatting with other staff members . finally a blonde woman asks if we would like our bill . she brings it to us and when i give her my card i gently advise her they forgot my prosciutto and it s on the bill . another guy brings the bill back for me to sign . the dollar prosciutto is still on it . i inform him that there was no prosciutto and i told the other woman but it s still here . i don t know if she thought i was just making small talk or what but i sure am not paying bones for some sliced ham that wasn t even on my pizza . he took care of it . here s the deal . i don t know if it s because i didn t wait hours to eat or if it s just falling apart without chef bianco but pb has definitely lost it s way and is quickly losing the legacy he created whether they want to acknowledge it or not . i used to think the staff was short and slightly rude because of how busy it was and dealing with upset starving customers brings them down but now i know that is not the case . they are just not good at what they do and have been there getting away with it for too long . just because pb is famous and chef bianco is world renown doesn t mean you are . the dough is good enough to come back for but there is simply no way i would ever wait in line to eat here again . if you read my previous review you will see i am not a pb hater and actually was a huge advocate . i guess all good things really do come to an end .

1,"i called several pool service companies before choosing desert gator pool service . when we bought our house i insisted to my husband that we could take care of the pool . . . all we needed was someone to come check the chemicals once a month . oh sure . after about one week , mustard algae , a bad storm , and a cranky pool pump , we were looking for a pool guy . we called them on a saturday and the owner of desert gator was kind enough to come to our home at am the following monday to fit with our schedules . we had our service set up that week and have been very happy ever since . they definitely got our pool under control and taught us quite a bit along the way . we still have them coming once every week it s so worth it . our pool was in bad shape after a recent storm and they were incredibly responsive . i think they came two or three times that week without charging us more . per month . . . but can be a bit more if you need parts and chemicals .

0,"ahh man , . . . . . i really wanted this to be good . but honestly , you end up with something that s more like flame broiled than the earthy wood fired imagery you pick up from their corporately consistent signage , menu , and decor . that being said , it s a cool concept , and great crust but the signature pizzas like the greek end up feeling themed , and lacking of soul and an intuitive fussing over that they need to really be crack good . the salad s , while seemingly possessing all the right stuff are the same . too salty too soggy , and somehow too rich . the gelato tastes like it must come from a squeeze tube . anyhow enough bitching . better than pizza hut , but for all the fuss and flash , you expect alot more .

1,"this was my first half marathon . i enjoyed the music the buzz of tens of thousands of people all about to do a crazy long run . it was amazing seeing the sunrise over the city . i found the parking , shuttles at tempe and food court to be very easy to use . it seemed well planned for such a large event , just not enough bathrooms for the amount of people . the pa for the full marathon kept going in and out so it introduced the star athletes but you couldn t hear their reason for being there or accomplishments . bathrooms on the course were way too few and huge lines . i felt bad for those who needed them . i saw less than at the first stops for people . if you gotta go on the course , too bad , . . . take imodium on race day i guess . bands and support were fantastic , but this was my st time so can t compare . . . . gu gel is always on me , great to see them out there . the course is not flat having a heartbreak hill in it at mile aprox . . ups gear check bag split apart at a feather s touch the day before the race . good thing , i was going to use it . the top of the seam isn t sealed so any slight pressure tear will open the entire side . ha about the author interesting background my first endeavor was a rolerblade marathon in tucson in . i guess it s out of style now so no more skates . used to do the new times k in phoenix every year too . gone , sad . last year i did the tour de phoenix mile bike race on a lb . full suspension no lockouts mountain bike with slime in both tires and all my supplies on my bike and camelback . . . thought i was tough , till i tried running ! injuries were now a new thing now and it is much tougher per hour than biking , but about the same calorie burn . . . still love both . i did a sprint triathlon recently too . we all know running is hard you don t get extra calorie burn from impact stress but something about running and especially in this event captured my interest . on the way to the zoo last year i saw the half marathon pass by and said i think i could do that now boy was i wrong . . . it took me almost a year to train for this event , but what a worthwhile challenge . i did this as a run walk min run min walk . i learned from the galloway training method that this method is not only easier but faster than trying to run straight through . . i am capable of the constant run for this time but it winds up being slower than when i take walk breaks . i tested this with a k distance . i was minutes faster with a run walk than running straight through . look it up , may change your life too . i took minute walk breaks and i did my time goal of aprox . with bathroom break .

1,"what can i say that hasn t already been said about the food , or the view ? i know , i ll share the best part about my amazing birthday dinner at elements meeting executive chef beau macmillian . he didn t duck away when we made eye contact in the hallway , instead he broke away from his staff and came right up and introduced himself . he was so incredibly personable . he could have easily ignored us . i m sure he s approached on a regular basis now that he s such a tv personality . but instead , he chatted us up and he talked about how he was so inspired by asian food and how he wanted to bring that influence into his food and to arizona . before we knew it he was taking us in to see the latest renovations to elements kitchen ! he proudly showed off the latest upgrades . sure , there were new gadgets , but he even included skylights because his sous chefs said they hated never seeing the light of day . how cool is that ? and to be revealed next month is an expansion to the kitchen that includes a table for inside the kitchen . not a new concept for restaurants , but something chef macmillian is so excited about . there s no doubt that the food that he cranks out can be intimidating , but his latest endeavor speaks to his desire of having his guests witness the artistry behind the kitchen doors . this new addition promises to give you a full sensory experience before the plate even reaches your table from seeing , smelling and hearing what s happening in the kitchen to finally tasting the finished product . talk about mouth watering . here s hoping that i will one day get to sit at that table .

1,paradise bakery is one of those places that you can count on for always having something good when your driving around wanting more than a burger and not a sit down meal with a waiter . i love the cranberry turkey sandwich with fresh fruit . the nice thing to consider is that you can get a whole or a half on the sandwich of your choice . once you feel good about the healthy choices you ve made you encounter the cookie section at the register . all i m going to say is that the chocolate chip is to die for ! ! the chocolate chips just melt in your hands ! ! doesn t get any better than that ! ! paradise bakery does also have a great breakfast should you want a nice place to go after a nice hike or just want to treat yourself and a friend to great place to visit . put paradise bakery on your always good list ! !

0,"when checking in i was greeted by the general manager . it was nice talking to you michael i hope to see you at the westin la paloma . the sheraton is great for a night stay if you plan on going to the airport . i stayed with my family for one night and caught a shuttle to the airport at am complimentary . ugh so early , but my driver was very friendly . the night auditor was very helpful and was able to give my family a late check out till . so awesome ! i love late check outs , they make your day morning better . no need to rush . the bathroom is a little small , vanity area is limited but fully stocked and you get a loofa . my little sister and mom enjoyed the pool as well . nice small patio area to enjoy from your room too . if i ever have to fly out of phoenix or into phoenix and have to stay over my choice is definitely the sheraton phoenix airport .

1,"margie s just opened about two months ago . i stumbled upon it while looking for the eba cafe . this little place is open monday saturday , am to pm . it is a great stopping point for commuters looking to get a coffee or breakfast bagel pick me up , check some email they ve got free wireless ! and head into or out of tempe . i ordered a simple coffee and the egg and cheese toasted on an everything bagel . tasty and a truly satisfying treat without a ding to the wallet . the place is very clean , soft comfy couches near bright windows , and margie is just delightful . great place to chat and concentrate away from the main throws of other well worn coffee houses . expect to find me there often mainly because i want to keep this coffee house close , alive and well !

1,"oh boy . i was terrified of this place . curry peanut butter ? ? sun dried tomato peanut butter ? ? sick ! but once i went , i shockingly realized that somehow , it wasn t thaaat bad . while this is without a doubt , a place that little kids will love to come to and one that adults will grudgingly take them to , if you have to eat here and you re over , i recommend getting the veggie sandwich . it was the least scary lunch option on the menu that wasn t going to taste like a dessert . it had sun dried tomato peanut butter , lettuce , cucumbers and cheese . and it wasn t half bad . but it wasn t half good either . let s just say i was surprised that it wasn t disgusting , but i wouldn t go back again unless i had to take another little kid i was babysitting . the child in question , a little girl by the name of natalie , is my friend s daughter and she talked me into going here . she couldn t say more about the place she loves it ! and for lunch , she had some white chocolate peanut butter , banana , nutella and caramel concoction that made me sick just looking at it . but if you want to bring your little one somewhere different and fun that they will love you for , come here . this would be a cute spot to have a little birthday lunch for your kids with a couple pals that wouldn t cost much at all .

0,"ugh . my tip off should have been the guy who saw me reading the menu and came outside to tell me the food was good . but i was craving chinese , i work near the cofco center , and it was threatening to rain . i scanned the menu , found kung pao chicken , and ordered up . they told me minutes , and they were accurate . price was reasonable . waiting area was comfortable and well decorated . food was inedible . i got the lunch special , which include soup , egg roll , entree and fortune cookie . i couldn t eat any of it . the soup hot and sour was way too sour . i felt like i would get acid reflux if i ate it . i couldn t order the fried rice , because it contains peas i ve learned to ask . . . childhood trauma . the rice was clotted together and difficult to eat . the kung pao chicken contained a suspiciously generous amount of meat . . . so much so that i questioned whether it was actually chicken . i watch too many movies . the egg roll was just gross . it seemed like the wad of mushy veggies was wrapped in biscuit dough before it was deep fried . the fortune cookie was stale , and the fortune was even lame . i would ve done better to get soaking wet and hit up panda express .

1,amazing thrift store ! the owner was extremely kind and polite to me so i m not too sure why one reviewer was saying he was rude . they had baskets of clothes out front that were free for homeless or needy people which i thought was great considering places like goodwill often overcharge for clothing that should be donated to those in need . great find on a robert cavalli jacket and j . crew pants that were literally like new . prices were completely reasonable for quality second hand clothing . for sure will go back ! ! !

1,"i actually haven t had any of the cocktails here yet but the menu looked really amazing . there are lots of sake cocktails and yummy sounding martinis and they have a pretty good beer list , too . i had the tofu with red curry sauce and it was really good . i also had the oyster mushrooms which were also really good . i really like tapas as an idea , the small , inexpensive plates so you don t feel like you re spending a bunch of money even though you end up spending like fifty bucks . my friend happened to know the guy who was our waiter and he was very sweet . overall i d say it s a really great place to get a quick bite and have drinks with friends if you re feeling a little bit fancy .

0,"we tried this out last night . we won t be back . there is no indication when you walk in that it s a seat yourself restaurant . we stood like idiots at the hostess area until somone asked us if we needed something . we sat ourselves , and then sat and sat and sat because there was no server assigned to us . perhaps that is a reason to seat patrons , so a server knows they ve arrived ? finally , the hostess asked us if anyone had helped us , and she was very polite and took our order . our drinks came out fairly quickly , but then we waited and waited for our food . this would have been understandable if the placed had been packed , but it wasn t . it was maybe full on saturday and there seemed to be plenty of servers . there was one large party on the patio . i ordered the vegetarian salad can t remember what it was called that advertised avocado , jicama , beans , and other yummy things . when it arrived , there was a tiny little mushy sliver of avocado perched on top , and no more to be found . it was as if someone scraped up the dregs of an avocado from the rind of an empty one and flung it on my salad . it would have been more forgiveable if they had just forgotten it altogether . also , the white beans were undercooked . the pizzas were good . i ordered the local organic vegetable one without cheese , and it came loaded with summer squash , roasted carrots , olives local ? hmm . . . , leeks , roasted onions , and the crust was thin and crispy . my husband also enjoyed his pizza . i should actually grant an additional half star to the hostess waitress , who comped my salad when i complained about it . i was willing to pay for it , but she offered to take it off the bill . the final nail in the coffin was perhaps not the fault of the restaurant , but the large party out on the patio had elementary age kids literally running laps through the restaurant for the first minutes we were there . if ignorant parents are content to let their hellions ruin other diners experiences , then i m afraid it s left to the restaruant to politely and discreetely ask the parents to please reign them in . no such luck . anyway , this place has some things to work on . fortunately for us , there are too many other great businesses nearby for us to give it a second chance .

1,"i love every place on south mountain . i ve been wanting to try a monte cristo for awhile now . the wait was well worth it . massive flavor explosion in the mouth . finished it off , chased it with fresh lemonade , and seriously wanted to order round two . for sure will be back next week for that second one . "
1,i was very excited to find this place as you will be when you walk inside and find nice clothes and accessories for even nicer prices ! there are several locations throughout the east valley . treat yourself . you will be happy you did . 
1,"wow ! i had read and heard alot of good things about smeeks and i thought , it must be too good to be true , and while out shopping for a few items today , i was proven wrong . i walked in and i instantly felt like a kid in a candy store . they had candy , fun novelties , and i swear everything i looked at it made me think of a friend who would love to find it in their stocking on christmas day . the store was packed it is days before christmas , but the staff was friendly , helpful and went around to make sure everyone found what they needed or if they needed a basket . guys , i ll be back here throughout the year , and you should check it out . if it doesn t make you smile or make you want to sift through all the goodies , you probably kick kittens for fun and that s not cool ! .

1,i am from new york and always asked where do i get best pizza ? hands down lamps pizzeria is the best ! ! ! ! ! ! always fresh ingredients and friendly staff and owner . 
1,love this place ! wish we had one here in ca . great vibe once you walk through that door . fantastic drinks and goodies ! ! 
1,"this is one of those places that i always seem to forget to review . i guess maybe because it seems everyone already knows this place is great ! ! the important details you need to know live music sometimes great happy hour food specials most wines of the wine list is a glass before pm . use your yelp check in offer to drop that to . yes i said three dollars ! ! ! ! ! ! great bruschetta , burgers , and everything else . chef s specials are often enough vegetarian so that s nice for someone like me great back patio that isn t super obvious to a first timer that it exists clean bathrooms ! you know all of the above doesn t matter in the slightest bit if the restrooms are nasty wine specials on the th of every month . now , i have never participated but i think it s like for a specific wine . but since you can use the yelp check in offer , i haven t bothered since it s cah razy cheap every day ! !

0,unfortunately this ups location is less than friendly or helpful . try the location near fry s in fountain hills . they are very friendly and helpful ! ! 
1,"can not say enough good about this place . i love it . i love it ! i simply love it ! we have always had really great service and the food ! well , the chips are thin and salty yumness and i love the salsa . they keep you filled up and aren t like other places which try to ignore an empty container ! number combo is my guilty pleasure ! i have had it many times the way it s intended chicken enchiladas with red sauce . . . but lately i ve been getting it with fundito sauce and i ve gotta tell you i m hooked ! try it . . . . . . . . it s a little more but so worth it ! i haven t had desert since i m gluten free but the size of the fried ice cream is gigantic . my daughter swears by it ! man , i wish they were open right now . . . cravings have begun anew . . . .

1,"it seems totally unbelievable that , not only did i hang out for more than an hour at a mall , but an outside one at that in degree heat . i attribute my ability to withstand these two unfavorable conditions to two things bonnie tea infusion it was bonnie s choice to grab some drinks at what she described as a great , independently owned tea shop located at tempe marketplace . i m not a tea connoisseur by any means , and i generally distrust fads i . e . , this silly sounding thing called boba tea , but i agreed cause if bonnie likes it , it s gotta be worth checking out , right ? parking wasn t too much of a hassle on a sunday afternoon , and we surprisingly got a space close to an entrance to the district , just outside of barnes and noble . inside , the shop looked much like a starbucks and i don t mean to imply that it was uninspired or anything . it was clean , modern and consisted of a long counter behind which two employees busily hand mixed tea and smoothie concoctions , along with a few tables chairs . the menu was extensive and separated into black , green and white teas , any of which i could get hot or cold . . . i think . i picked the tropics white in iced form , and b got my second choice , a peach mix white . both were pretty delicious . there was also a selection of sandwiches and snacks that i did not sample next time . i also ran into a good friend there who was delighted by the fact that they had this mystical boba , and so ordered a chai type version with blueberry sized and shaped balls floating on the bottom , and an oversized straw to facilitate sucking them up along with the drink . i tried one boba ball and it was gelatinous and chewy not at all like what i expected and an odd sensation , but i would totally order one the next time i m in . being in the district and flanked by stores like hottie inc . and guess , there were several teens inside hanging out in large numbers boo . so , we decided to sit outside for as long as we could stand it . i was surprised to find that the several shaded tables and misters made for a pretty comfortable environment , and we hung out for a good hour or so before i got so sweaty i have to get mobile . so , in summary , i would totally come back . probably before or after a movie , to grab a drink and support an independent store among a mecca of chain retail . plus , right across the way there is an asu art gallery closed sunday and monday that we peeked into and actually cool , interesting sculpture art by local artist and asu instructor david young . touche , the district at tempe marketplace i have to say i am impressed !

0,"i love the layout of this outdoor bar . however , the price of drinks here and the lack of well options is a huge turn off . it s also going to be interesting to see if people are into the idea of an outdoor dance club once summer comes back around . the view is awesome . i m always up for supporting independent downtown businesses , this place just needs to make some changes to make me want to come back .

1,"amazing . fogo de chao is nothing short of out of this world . it is expensive , but as soon as you start , you ll know exactly where that money went . seriously . try it . "
1,"awesome , big ben sandwich is delish and chocolate strawberry scones is one of the best i have ever had , and can t forget to mention the coffee and tea , great place"
0,"good food when it s slow . not so good when super busy . this is usually a great place to stop after watcning a show at the harkins theater nearby . if the lot is full on a friday or sat night i would pass and go somewhere a little less overwhelmed . although the service there has always been pretty good for us , the food is hit and miss .

1,"pros good pizza fancy , expensive but not outrageously expensive clean interior outside setting with heating lamps to add to setting . good drinks got a green tea , the name of the tea , called infusion , lives up to it s name ! ! ! the design of the outside , and inside , makes the place a for the interior . the food is great ! me and a friend shared pizza toppings were meaty sausage and cheese . the bill didn t come out to a large amount . the wait was a tad excessive . there s a bar . friendly service . cons none for me , been here only once and will never be here again because we were tourists"
0,the food was decent . my friend and i had the meatball sub and marinara chicken sub . i know this is stereotyping but being served food my real italians i expected more spice and flavor in the food . the alcohol selection is small but has the essentials beer and wine . i want to go back and check out the pizzas before i write this place off . 
0,"i am furious . in the last months , i have had at least scheduling issues , from them calling me at am on a saturday morning my day off to cancel my am appointment to last saturday , when i went in only to be told someone had messed up , and actually booked me for the next week , and despite me driving all the way out there at am , they couldn t get me in until maybe that evening , and then not with someone who had experience in deep tissue medical massage . i was irritate and ready to ask for my membership refunded then , but ashley the clinic manager promised me that they d give me my next week appointment free of charge , and that she d personally be certain there were no more issues . as i literally couldn t turn my head to the left due to pain , i took her up on that . big mistake . yesterday the friday before my correctly scheduled massage , i went out of my way to call in and confirm my own bloody appointment , to try and avoid last week s debacle . according to the woman who answered the phone , it looked like my schedule therapist was actually scheduled off , but she went to talk with her manager , and came back to the phone telling me everything was ok , and that she d call with any issues . then yesterday evening , i got another confirmation call from massage envy , confirming and reminding me of my am appt on saturday with my preferred therapist . given that i ve had migraines this week versus my or when i get a massage the weekend prior , i really absolutely needed to get in , so i felt more confident . well , i was just woken up at am . . . again . on my day off . . . again . to explain to me that , big shock , they messed up my scheduling again , and that apparently , my therapist was off today . despite ashley s promise of it not happening again . despite me being pro active and calling to confirm . i am sitting here in pain , so furious at this repeated treatment that i can t even go back to bed . . . and the best part ? they don t even have a manager on duty i can complain to . my treatment at the hands of the booking front desk staff has been any thing but relaxing . i continue to walk out of there frustrated , angry , and occasionally in tears . i know they say fool me once , shame on you , fool me twice , shame on me , but i was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt . i m pretty screwed for today and the next week , but luckily , an elements place with a similar concept opened recently in the general area . at this point , it literally cannot be any worse than massage envy . as much as i love talisha and aisha as massage therapists , getting a massage should feel good , and not like you re just a number to them , not like you actually have to spend more time trying to get a damn appointment than you actually get to spend in the appointment .

1,"combination chicken fast food joint and gas station ? yessss ! it s so convenient when i need to fill my car and my stomach ! joking aside this popeye s isn t bad . pretty much what you expect if you like their chicken . all of the workers seem really nice here too , they normally let you know if they have any specials but i would be sure to ask them just in case . and while you re waiting for your food you can just pop in the gas station store they re connected . if not , they also have a drive thru .

1,"always consistent quality and value . we have been regulars of pappadeaux in our previous home of tx , and we still are big fans ! "
0,"solid . we hit up the happy hour which features off booze and tacos for . . i had the duck , shrimp , and cochinita pibil pork . they were tinier than most street style tacos i ve had and boy howdy , have i eaten a lot of those from cali to ny and even a little soggy . the duck was my least favorite as it had a rubbery taste and texture . the shrimp was a ok but for my money , the cochinita was really where it s at with his super porkey deliciousness . we also split the queso fundido rich with cream cheesey chunks , whaaaat ? ? ? . it was way tasty but it could probably double for spackle in a pinch . the most successful item of the night was the churros with goat cheese caramel . between my buddies and myself , we made quick work of that dish . each of us had their house margarita which was strong just like i like it , but i m not entirely sure i d order that drink for non happy hour prices . one of the big drawbacks , however , was that our server was really rushed and we had a hard time getting his attention . on the whole , i think i d be back to try some other items . the chicken mole torta looked really appealing . be forewarned though , it is a spendy joint . expect to pay for most entrees . on a post grad shoestring budget , it is certainly a splurge . we did love the mural outback and the groovy art inside .

1,"true food kitchen claims to not be a health food restaurant , rather a place for great food that just so happens to be healthy . whatever you want to call it , when you sit down , you ll be handed a card explaining nutrition guru dr . andrew weil s food philosophies and explaining their ingredients and food items until you no longer have an appetite . however , give this place a chance it s not all about health at the sacrifice of flavor . the decor perfectly highlights the culinary concept , with clean , modern lines , big open windows , and lots of green . andrew s elixir , one of their refresher drinks , was delightful . the best food item we had was the caramelized onion tart appetizer , with gorgonzola cheese , black figs , and caramelized onions on a crispy flat crust . it was the perfect balance of the sweet mild onions and sweet figs with savory cheese and light , crispy crust . our server said this is the same crust as their pizzas , so next time i d like to try those . next , we had the edamame dumplings , which is basically steamed won tons filled with pureed edamame in a light miso broth . these were good , not great . for our entree , we ordered the black cod , but we had to send it back because it was so fishy and undercooked . when i asked the server if the fish is fresh or fresh frozen , he said , well , they re all fresh frozen . their fish entrees are , which seems inexpensive , but they re fairly small portions . for that kind of price in this type of restaurant , i would expect fresh fish . perhaps the fresh frozen fish is a cost cutting measure in what seems to be the increasingly corporate sam fox empire . we went with the salmon instead , which was also undercooked but far less fishy . the roasted apples and pureed celery root were lovely , but the dish as a whole was a little overpowered by the mustard sauce , and the accompanying vegetables were weird . prices overall are very reasonable , especially if you stick with appetizers , salads , pizzas , and sandwiches . true food aims for the lofty goal of making great cuisine that just so happens to be extremely healthy , and occasionally misses the mark , but i give them credit for bringing dr . andrew weil s philosophies on the importance of nutrition for the body and mind to the mainstream .

1,i visited sala thai with a friend and i had the pad thai . food was pretty tasty and very filling . it had a nice tang but i might have preferred to have a fork and knife to cut the very long noodles with . other than that i d definitely visit again . 
1,"what a great way to spend easter morning ! after taking part in the egg hunt on the main grounds and btw , they know how to do it here massive dumps of eggs full of goodies . more than the kids could carry . plenty of photo ops . parents who weren t acting out scenes from soylent green . we made our way to this nicely upscale coffee shop casual dining spot . we were seated minutes ahead of our reservation , keeping my little guy from popping a gasket . i chose the breakfast buffet , and considering it included a custom made omelette with organic ingredients as well as juice and coffee it was a steal . service was wonderful and the staff was sure to make us feel at home . well , actually better than home because i don t have people looking after my every whim and need while at home .

1,"i went here with my book club and they definitely gave us lots to roar about . their happy hour is only good in their bar which was fully packed or out on their patio . their patio is fabulous ! who would have thought a patio in arizona in july could be so cool and welcoming . great atmosphere . the waiter was very accommodating about all of us arriving at different times and peppering him with various drink and food orders . i had the most delicious huckleberry frozen margarita . perfectly smooth out of a machine to be that consistent . it was basically a plain lime margarita with a generous drizzle of huckleberry sauce on it . the huckleberry sauce was slightly tart not syrupy or sweet but delicious ! it went down very smooth . i had the fish tacos which were messy and the salsa verde was finger licking good . i am amazed that , during the summer , they have happy hour until pm ! ! ! woohoo ! overall , a delightful experience and i will go back . "
0,"ok . . . so i am a sucker for a great breakfast joint that isn t some huge national chain . maybe it s the fact that orange county seriously lacks many good breakfast joint option . secondly , the fact that they have dog friendly patio service elevates the place in my book . our trips to scottsdale aren t complete until we make a stop here for breakfast . the portions are huge ! the surprising part is that the food is good , which is not usually the case with places with places that do large portions usually hoping that size covers up the taste . with their mexican options such as the breakfast burrito or huevos ranchero . . . they knock the cover off the ball . the green chil pork in the huevos rancheros is fantastic and keeps me coming back for it .

1,somebody please tell me why qt is the best gas station convenience store ever ? the layout is the same for every one . the bathrooms are always less gross than other convenience stores . the service is always phenom . gas is usually relatively cheaper than other stations in the area . plus its like a one stop shop for emergency got to have it now s like snickers and chicharones and energy drinks and milk and wipies right ? hahaha ! i don t know . my yelp told me to write a review . . . d

1,i came here for a yelp event and had a great time . they have the place somewhat divided into two sections bar and restaurant . i liked that the patio opens right into the bar so you kind of have an extended bar . the food was really good and the staff rocked . i have been meaning to go back . i ll put that on my to do list !

1,"i ve been planning a visit to the public market for some time now , and was downtown today so i finally stopped in for lunch . i had the friggin chicken , which was friggin delicious . the market fare is counter service , but when i was ordering the cashier was very friendly and courteous and brought my food to me out on the patio . this was a very pleasant first experience , sitting on the patio reading a book , sipping my canned mint green tea , and eating my sandwich with a side of couscous . the atmosphere was very relaxed and there were others nearby sharing a bottle of wine , or just finishing up their lunch with good conversation . speaking of the wine , there was an impressive wine and craft beer selection . i ll be going back to sample the beverages very soon . on my way out , i stopped at the coffee bar for a latte , which was much more bold and flavorful than your fast food coffee variety a great way to finish off my lunch . if you re looking for a quick , inexpensive , fresh and local dining experience , check this place out .

0,"i would love to give yoli s a higher rating but there were different factors that occurred that morning . when we arrived they were closing early and had very little left on their menu as they were reviewed by a local tv station and ran out of food . that is a good thing they were receiving recognition but not good for someone who was stopping in for the first time . we decided to sit outside on the patio , water began to leak from the roof and you had to move to a different seat . they blew it off as oh well , when food arrived , i was not impressed with what they had to offer . the food had little flavor . it is hard to give a fair rating because they did not have their popular foods available . it was disappointing that we paid for an average meal . we will try yoli s again soon , we are hoping it is wonderful !

1,"we ve got another first timer here . . . ! i am just as shocked as the next person that after many years in seattle , i had never had bubble tea . gasp ! you can get it almost as readily as starbucks . i learned it s also called boba and maybe one other name . it s all the same to me . same same . i had my first boba initiation at the recent office hours with gabi . i was completely overwhelmed by the options presented to me what type of chewies for the record , that term just doesn t seem right , base drink , optional flavorings , etc . it was a lot for this gal to handle . luckily , alica b . was at my side leading me down the boba path . she helped me pick out a concoction of thai iced tea and regular boba . gotta start with the original boba , right ? she ended up with a coffee drink with coffee jellies . i feel like i m now in the know because she asked for the coffee jellies and even though they weren t on the menu , they indeed had them . that s a little insider s tip from me to you . wink wink . she was so excited i thought she was going to consider this woman the patron saint of boba and commence worship on the spot . i was surprised to find how incredibly filling boba is . i wasn t hungry for hours ! overall , it was good . i don t see myself craving boba , but if someone wants to go , then i m in . i ll check out the jellies in my next go round . if the craving is boba , i would definitely recommend this place !

1,similar to joe s farm grill we make sure this is one of our regularly yearly places to hit whenever we can . piles of bbq d meat ? yes please free birthday meal ? hell yeah homemade rootbeer ? i m moving in we ve had consistently great food and service every visit and to top it off on my birthday they gave my friend a free meal too because he was in the military . you can t beat that kind of hospitality
1,"this place is as good as i d heard . we came here for a day late birthday dinner for my middle daughter father s day dinner for her husband . she and his six year old daughter ordered a hawaiian style with pineapple and ham , he and i got the margherita pizza with garlic , tomatoes , olive oil , fresh basil , mozzarella , and romano cheese . both were so delicious ! he also got some chicken wings which were tender and juicy and not spicy at all , dipped in either of two great sauces , ranch or marinara . the pizza s were about each for the larges . i usually have no problem quitting after two slices but the flavor squishing around in my mouth was so good i couldn t resist taking a third piece at this place . the decor was pretty and the service was great the server checked back several times to see if we were doing okay or needed anything . i would definitely be a regular if i lived near here . on a side note , next door is the aloha kitchen which we had eaten at about a week ago and was also very good !

1,"this place is old school . i . e . you don t come here for the service , or the ambiance especially since it s in a scary part of town . you come for the food . come with a group of friends , whether for dim sum or a late night dinner . you need a group of people , i hate coming here when its just mean and three others . i like to taste and sample lots of goodies . they have great live seafood a must in my book where you can walk by and see what looks good that day . be brave and check it out !

1,"i took my computer to redseven recently when my friends were calling and telling me i had a nasty virus that was sending out gobs of email every fifteen mins . i had no idea my computer was infected . i was hesitant to do so because i needed my computer to do some work . no worries , the fellas over at redseven hooked me up with a loaner . i was able to get online and get my work done and get my home pc back the next day without missing a beat . i was going to take my computer to one of those big box store repair places . i am so glad i didnt . a friend of mine took their pc there and when it came back all of their family pictures , music and email was gone . i will only be using redseven in the future and i suggest you do the same .

0,"personally , i used to come here a lot more often than i do . i ve noticed , what i feel to be , a rather slide in the quality in the food . the carne asada burrito i recently got tasted okay , but the meat tasted lesser quality than i was used to . the guacamole was a bit thinner than i like . i gave them this score due to them having much better history with me and i hope think suspect they had a weak day . if they do better or worse next time , i ll post something that will reflect it .

0,"the first thing i respect about rula bula is its ability to attract customers while keeping a low profile . no flashing lights , no pound bouncers with angry stares , and no promotional cards being shoved in my face from down the street . i walked in and liked what i saw . it has an old school feel to it . there was a live band doing some lady gaga covers , and it sounded like karaoke . i wasn t impressed , so i ordered my jameson reasonably priced and walked out to the patio . it was a good patio , with a dj in the corner . it had a different feel to it , and i appreciate how laid back it was . but it felt like something was missing . i waltzed back inside , admired a much better cover of micheal jackson and realized the one thing i couldn t find here . fun . to a west sider like myself , tempe is the mecca of mischief , a place where i can have one too many and stumble back home with a story to tell . there was a dance floor , but no one was dancing . there were tons of people , but every group kept to themselves . even though i don t go to bars to meet women , there was a suspicious lack of pretty ones in here . it s like everyone who was too old or uncool to go elsewhere came to have a guinness in peace . i came here expecting a fun bar that wasn t a full blown club , and instead of getting a happy medium i ended up with a boring dive . don t get me wrong , i fucking love dive bars , but i don t go to mill ave for them . rula is a good place with good history . i can t hate on it . i love the interior , and i could see myself coming back during the day . it s just not worth going out of my way on a saturday night .

0,"don t get me wrong , white chocolate grill is good and definitely a place i will go back to , but there is something that just doesn t click . everything tastes good and the service is fast and efficient but it is more of a relaxed dinner that a meal you get excited about . i can t say for everyone i really don t like waiting a half hour for a table . call me impatient i don t care , i really do not think many restaurants deserve that title even on a friday night . i do love that they have an entire menu for gluten free diners . it s so hard to find gluten free in restaurants don t even mention an entire menu ! i was impressed ! i ended up splitting artichokes with parmesan ask for no bread crumbs with my mom and got myself a chicken caesar . both were decent . we did end up ordering a gluten free chocolate souffl make sure to specify that you want it gluten free because they had a normal version as well which was amazing and i would definitely go there just for that . overall a good family weeknight restaurant that is that is above average meal . definitely a place to go if you have celiacs or are gluten intolerant .

1,truly a great place ! the flights are fantastic ! the food great ! service also great ! try this place ! seriously the fewer words to describe the greatness the better . 
1,love the bar ! the two guys that sing and play music there wed thru sat nights are just amazing . manuels has very authentic mexican food . best enchiladas and refried beans around . bar is adorable after being renovated recently . restaurant could use some updating . 
1,zipps is a rocking place with tv screens in all viewable angles . the atmosphere is great and this place really packs it in on game nights like monday night football . smoking is outside because this place is around the tempe border . the service is great and the food is even better . try the chicken tacos ! good times had by all ! check it out some time ! 
1,"i went here with my parents on a super crowded friday evening . we had to wait about min , but decided to order a couple of drinks while we waited . once we finally got seated , i decided to order the chicken madeira , which is their most popular dish . it was sooo good ! it was a huge portion , but i somehow managed to finish it . i can see why everyone loves it ! my dad ordered the ahi and had to get them cook it more b c it was practically raw and cold . it was probably supposed to be like that , but he didn t know what he was getting himself into . they took extra care in getting this done both our waiter and the manager came over to make sure they were on the same page as my dad before cooking it more thoroughly . they also brought my dad a complimentary house salad while he waited . we decided to end our meals by all splitting a piece of their peanut butter cup cheesecake . omg . so good . most importantly , we found that the service at this location was really good ! our waiter was funny , and rolled with the punches . . . nothing seemed to phase him .

1,the tuna sandwich is fabulous ! ! ! definitely visit this place ! ! 
1,"part of a social event , we only had app s here . quite delicious crab cakes and a shrimp fritters with mango sauce . the portions were gigantic and actually big enough for a meal . i was slightly full afterwards . part of the roaring fork , wildfish franchise , they also offer a great happy hour . seems a bit high priced but our bill was taken care of , so i d save this for the middle class foodie for a special event . "
1,"open late , that is a huge plus ! been here for lunch and for dinner , also in different times of the year . service is always stellar . food is always good . sometimes there is something weird with the check such as charging for things that were supposed to be included or full price for happy hour items or something like that . not sure why that keeps happening , there seems to be some pressure on the staff . otherwise , the place is trendy and seems small and loud in the busy times , spacious and accommodating when just the right amount of people . best time is dinner , in a booth , not on a weekend and when you are really hungry as the food portions are generous . "
1,"from the moment you enter this place you get the feeling that you are entering some swanky underground restaurant , the lighting is dark and the decor is mysterious ! ! i am in love with the fashionable staff who come to work wearing what they want as well as the chef in the back with the inch mohawk . the drink menu is stocked with exciting choices such as in between the sheets and the dirty school girl ! not your average bar ! the best thing on the menu in my opinion is the house made fettuccine . honestly the best homemade meat sauce ever and i am hard to please considering i was raised on bolognese sauce ! a great place to take a date whether it be your first or th this place will never disappoint .

1,"i have to say i am not a big valentine s fan . i don t like hallmark holiday s . we ended up by chance going to mimi s for valentine s day and they had a great menu and price for that menu for the evening . i am just impressed by their service , portion size and just the overall experience . i just love this place .

1,"we went to the science center for their body exhibit and then walked around to find something to eat . we chose the rose and crown because it was close , not too fancy and the music pouring out was great . we ate out on the beautiful porch of this amazing house and although we don t drink , we were welcomed and enjoyed the experience . i asked the waiter for his dinner suggestion and went with it fish and chips , my husband ordered the shepherds pie . both were quite delicious . i even took the time to use the restroom and to see the inside of the restaurant and enjoyed the ambiance throughout the pub . i will definitely be back with friends to enjoy again .

1,"attention all parents , nannies , guardians etc . koko bees is tons of fun ! the kids are all smiles full of laughter . terrific environment oodles of play houses , dress ups , costumes , toys , themes settings ! the little ones imaginations can run wild . they even offer fantastic dance , sports , yoga and tumbling classes for the children ! this is a great place to come with the kiddos ! !

0,"i really enjoy writing reviews praising a place for great food , service , ambiance , and value , or any combination of these . unfortunately , this isn t one of those reviews . this is a fish story . . . no , not about the big one that got away . nor is it about the time i was fly fishing with my dad and had to rescue him because he stepped in a deep hole and sank when his waders filled with water . . . . this is about the trout that saved the day . when my wife and i arrived at the greene house , it was earlier in the evening , still happy hour , though we were there for dinner not appetizers . checked in with the hostess and were quoted a quoted minute wait for a table . we knew the place was popular so weren t upset with the wait as we were looking forward to a wonderful dinner . went to the bar to order wine and that s when our disappointment started . we were sitting in plain view at the edge of the bar facing the entry and there were two bartenders , in spite of this , in the minutes we waited , occasionally waving and saying excuse me to get the bartenders attention , we never even got so much as a hi , and certainly not an opportunity to order a drink . i had only just told my wife i wasn t willing to wait another minutes wine free when the hostess pleasantly surprised us by saying a table was ready . our relief was short lived however . after being seated , it was approximately minutes before our server came to the table . we ordered wine and water . our wine and water came nine minutes later . . . a total of over minutes since we entered the restaurant before we received our first beverage . we skipped an appetizer , planning ahead for dessert , and for our entree ordered rainbow trout with a side of truffle parmesan fries . approximately minutes later , our side of truffle parmesan fries showed up . . . sans trout . when asked about the missing trout , she said it d be a few more minutes because the kitchen was backed up . when asked why she brought the side of fries , she said she thought we wanted them first , a leap of logic that totally escaped us . when our server said she could take the fries back to keep them warm until our trout was ready , my wife and i looked at each other in amazement and made a spontaneous decision that given we were now starving , our original side of fries would serve us better as a hot appetizer than as a reheated side with dinner . finally , a few minutes after our truffle parmesan fries were gone , our trout arrived . as i indicated in the begining , it saved the day . the fish was fresh , perfectly prepared and exceptional . as good as the trout was however , is wasn t good enough to make us ever return to the greene house . there is no reason any customer should suffer through such slow and uninspired service when there are at least a dozen restaurants within a mile radius of this one much less dozens more throughout the phoeniz metro area , that are significantly more enjoyable . spend your hard earned money somewhere else"

1,"the lodge has been a pretty consistent happy hour spot for me over the last year and a half . their food and drink specials are a great way to wrap up the week on a friday night . i like their chicken strips and the cheese curds are great . the pretzels are also delicious . service is typically pretty good , you ll be able to keep drinks coming and food comes out quickly . there s a lot of entertainment there , with corn hole and giant jenga outside , and some video games and a pool table inside . i don t love the lodge as much for a prime time or late night spot . . . it gets a lot more expensive and a lot more crowded . go for happy hour , order some cheese curds and a miller lite and you re bound to have a good time . the decor is kinda fun , there are random acts of taxidermy inside and it s very , uh . . . log cabin like . a funny but pretty well known fact about this place is that jared allen minnesota vikings is a part owner of the lodge , so from time to time you may run into him and some other nflers there .

1,"i grew up at word of grace now city of grace . way before the new buildings and it just the small little church . i love pastor gary . i would give him stars . we moved but i had always considered this my home church . when we moved back to az i started again and was really disappointed with the young adults ministry and praise and worship . i left when i wasn t getting anything out of it and not much longer did they join with city church . i think they are struggling but i have hope for them . pastor terry is the new head pastor and he has the joel osteen vibe , which isn t for me , but he is very nice . they are non denominational and love their congregation enough to handle sins or situations other churches don t want to touch in fear of being labeled as haters or what not . i hope that anyone who attends will understand their views do not come from hate . it makes me sad that the other reviewer had such a negative experience and i don t doubt that she wasn t treated with kindess as every church seems to have those rude people . i am not sure what she means by closed minded but i know there are people like that at every church . i hope others do not have that experience and i hope the church can work on that as a whole . people need to feel welcome and accepted as they are . they are also awesome with the community homeless outreaches , drug addiction help , and so many things i cannot begin to list . if you ever want to help your community city of grace would be a great place to get ideas of where how you can help . if pastor terry isn t for you i would recommend cornerstone chandler my home church or central christian . they are not closed minded but they also won t ignore sins that are major issues . ie divorce , porn , sex , sexuality , infedility , etc . good luck on finding your home church ! !

0,"got a recommendation to eat here from a friend and was somewhat disappointed . expecting a sit down restaurant with wait service , i was surprised to find it layed out more like a fast food joint with the addition of a bar kind of odd . the service was fast and friendly , but the food was average and didn t seem quite warm enough and got cold very fast as a result . the best part about dining here was the churro i picked up on my way out , which was surprisingly delicious . all in all , i don t see myself returning to the blue burrito grille unless it s to pick up a churro or two after seeing a movie at the nearby theater .

0,"the pizza s ok , not anything to write home about . i sat on the outdoor patio , which is on the main street , so while entertaining to watch all the people go by and there s a wide variety , if you re table s right along the outside edge of the patio which i wasn t , you may end up interacting with the transients coming by . so , i got to observe everyone going by without having to interact with them , which was just fine by me , because i do like to people watch .

1,"by far my favorite mediterranean restaurant in arizona ! the service is always awesome , the place is always clean , and the environment is always welcoming and friendly . i love hole in the wall , family owned restaurants because [at least the ones i have been to] there is always a sense of pride in their service and their food . i ve been to this restaurant a few times and have loved everything i have tried . i like being able to taste flavor , not seasoning , and their dolmeh appetizer is just that a perfect medley of herbs , grape leaves , and rice . i usually order the beef kebab , but i have tried their chicken and gyros and lamb kebab . the meat , be it beef , chicken , lamb , or gyro , is always moist and tender . like their meat , the grilled vegetables have a perfect blend of crispy and lightly seared on the outside , but juicy and steamed on the inside . the basmati rice is always thoroughly cooked and flavorful . the same goes for the homous , baba ganoosh , and yogurt cucumber dip . i highly recommend their house combination platter . the pitas are always warm and their homous and ganoosh have the perfect texture . try to go around p to beat the dinner rush . the place is always packed on saturday nights , so show up a little before regular dinner time if you want to ensure seating for your party !

1,"do you like trendy shit music and half dressed plastic surgery queens gyrating all around you , while you pay twelve dollars for your appletini ? if your answer is yes , don t bother coming here . dive bars are plentiful in phoenix , but the bikini is in my hood . it s a dirty , unassuming place , with a couple of no nonsense bartenders and a good jukebox . there are a couple of rules to follow when visiting the bikini . bring cash . cards aren t accepted , the atm machine is there for decoration only , as it hasn t worked in at least two years . . don t make fun of the guy in the overalls and farmer hat . he s my neighbor . . don t piss off the bartenders . tip them well , treat them nicely , and don t order more than three dirty martinis . if you are nice to them , they will be nice to you . this includes , but is not limited to the strength of your drinks , the price of your drinks , and whether or not you get a drink at all . they take no shit . if you can t handle it , stay away . the place gets crowded enough as it is .

0,"i went to pei wei last night for a casual girls night dinner . it was a perfect place for a group of girls to meet because of the following it s cheap it s fast casual so each person pays their own bill and then sits down no stress when the bill comes as is often the case with groups there is plenty to choose from on the menu for those that are picky or dieting , they are great about special orders , sauce on the side , etc . . . that being said , pei wei is just average in my eyes never my first choice of places to go , but i can always find something to eat . . . last night i had the shrimp teriyaki bowl with brown rice . the shrimp tasted like it came from the freezer probably because it did , but the veggies , rice , and sauce were all pretty good . i noticed they changed the menu a bit since my last visit , and a new special is a vietnamese noodle bowl pho type dish . the chicken lettuce wraps and edamame are always safe bets and hopefully will remain on their menu forever . i m sure i ll be back to pei wei because of the positive factors listed above the concept is a good one , just don t compare it to a high end restaurant and enjoy it for what it is ! ps shout out to all the girls that came out last night i had fun seeing all of you and can t wait for the next one !

1,"i put forth that we need to institute a new standard of measurement to be used for comparing coffee shops . furthermore , i think that cartel coffee labs should use this place as a standard for this new unit of measurement . i have to assume it s called a coffee lab for a reason . too many coffee shops these days are retail stores , where coffee is an incidental thing in all the yelling , stupid names , and fancy colors . if you look at the menu of cartel coffee lab , there are a total of items . it s all about the coffee , plain and simple . then again , there s really nothing simple about it to those who take their coffee as seriously as this place does . the artistry of their baristas is not to be trifled with . these people can make a latte so pretty , you really won t want to drink it until you do , then you re happy you did . on top of that , the selection of coffee varietals is impressive . i ve only tried one , but that alone was better than anything starbucks tries to pawn off on the masses . perhaps the use of the term lab is because they ve actually stepped beyond anything any other coffee shop has done . either way , the formula that they came up with works better than anything i ve come across before . then again , maybe i m being too hard on the other places . it s not that they have an intrinsically inferior product , but the reason for these places has been lost behind t shirts and mugs and open mic nights and selling you a card containing the same money you d use on the place anyway . . . i digress . cartel coffee labs is a great place with a fantastic product . if their wifi is weak or the back corner gets dark , i honestly don t care . their coffee is excellent and i ll be coming back for more .

1,"we stopped here on a thursday night on a raving referral and they we not exaggerating this place is fantastic ! we are always a little hesitant to try a new place when an omnivore suggests it , but as vegetarians , we found sekong by night so accommodating ! they offered to convert nearly any dish on their menu into a vegan alternative , and it was delicious . the spring rolls are really big , and they swapped their fish dipping sauce for a vegan version . we had the phnom penh noodle soup with tofu veggie broth just like the vietnamese pho ! and the katheaw cha rice noodles with tofu instead of beef amazing . service was top notch , and as many other reviewers noted their prices are unbelievably low for the quantity and quality of food that you get . looking forward to our next visit and trying more fantastic dishes !

1,"a dark night in a city that knows how to keep its secrets . but on the th floor of the acme building , one man is trying to find the answers to life s persistent questions guy noir , private eye . theme it was a night in november . november rd in fact . i remember the date because it was my birthday . the snow birds that had started to flock from their summer homes had long since retired for the evening and the godfearing people of phoenix had closed shop . my two lovely companions and i were looking for a place to fill our bellies . like moths to a flame we were attracted to a dim light coming from a dark parking lot . we exited the car . are you going to mama mia s ? a beautiful petite girl with the kind of body men write home about stepped out of the shadows . i was going wherever she took me . we were led through the kind of kitchen you only see in mob movies . i wasn t going to ask what they put in the sausage . we stepped in and figured out our toppings . trying to figure out toppings for one pizza between three people you may as well be figuring out cold fusion with a box of toothpicks and some masking tape . but with the plethora of options i felt like i had a bag of bananas in a monkey whore house and we narrowed it to basil and fresh tomato . the pizza was exactly what a tired and famished private eye like myself needed on a night like this . man working register is that a wig ? jetta yeah its a wig . we left the pizza joint as happy as a twister in a trailer park . jetta i am so getting a weave . theme music a dark night in the city that knows how to keep its secrets , but a light shines on the th floor of the acme building guy noir , private eye ? . theme up and out "
1,"sakana is one of the few sushi places that i return to . there is usually always a wait no reservations , which is a pita , but the sushi is fresh , service is quick so it s not always super friendly , and the calamari salad is so effin good . their lunch specials remind me of something i d find in so . ca tasty , filling and reasonably priced . it s lively on the weekends with several tables doing sake bombs so it s a fun place to celebrate birthdays .

1,wow these cupcakes were amazing ! ! the frosting was picture perfect . i tried vanilla salted caramel and pumpkin and both were so good ! the cake on both were super dense and moist . vanilla salted caramel definitely was the best of the two ! 
1,"i always have fun here . i went here on new years this year and had a good time . i did see the most pathetic lesbian here . she wore her make up and dressed just ike the shane character in the lword . al i could think was , wow what a loser . and i wish i was that skinny do you have no personality that you wear a costume everyday . ! ! so i was with my girlfriend in line and we were holding each other . she walked away for five seconds and asked my girlfriend for her number . my girlfriend totally dissed her . i walked up and you could see the fear in her eye . she just kept saying sorry , sorry , sorry . well anyway aside from that i like this place . but dont go in the bathroom unless you have to . there are always tranny s doing coke or k in the womens bathroom . make sure and use a tissue to lock and unlock the stall"
1,"wow . this places is incredible . i can honestly say that everything on the menu is wonderful . it s the perfect date place , since you can order booze to cure the date jitters . also , you can satisfy your dieting girlfriend and still order a big plate of man food . the best part about their menu is the fact that it is so tasty with being healthy . the extra care in picking ingredients , grilling cooking with little fats , and unique spice combinations truly makes pj stand out . the decor s nod to local artists also helps make the dining room an enjoyable place to be . for a perfect healthy and satisfying vegetarian lunch i recommend the following a small greek salad with an order of the jalape o or roasted red pepper hummus ps they ll let you order the hummus half and half ! "
1,cho dang fo sho ! looking for korean food can be tricky . cho dang offers my favorite entree cooked just right . tofu soup w a fresh egg yum ! broth could be spicy but definitely worth the burnnnn . . . . urrr ! ! ! decor of the place i dig ! dark wood flooring with some picture frames of plants then the ceiling is painted sky blue to give you that outdoor serene feel . service was great my waiter was a young man that couldn t tell me what hite beer taste like told him to take a sip and let me know shhhh . . . don t tell anyone . needless to say my dinner was delectable definitely a return place enjoy my friends ! 
1,this place is great . it is very clean and the staff is very nice and accommodating . every time i walk out i am completely satisfied with the work . 
1,"this is the most progressive , inclusive , welcoming , diverse , intellectually stimulating , public service oriented church in the valley , if not the west coast . we ve been to more than a few and can attest to that . pastor jeff not only knows everyone s name but is genuinely concerned about everything that goes on in your life . the congregation is like one big family . love for your neighbors is not just a commandment at this church it s acted upon . if you re sick of churches that tell you what to believe in and don t act what they preach , you d better check this one out . services every sunday at am .

1,the food is always awesome . best in the area . the people behind the counter need to pull their heads out of their asses . don t be rude to me if i ask for an extra bag to carry my food . i d be happy to let the food drop to the floor for you to clean up . 
1,"we like this restaurant , it is always good food and good service and convenient to our home . "
1,"orange table is one of my go to spots in the valley . the food and atmosphere are superb . the wide assortment of beverages certainly strengthens ot s menu when pairing food and drink . i will admit that while the location may seem hard to find , there are times where i ve had to wait , and wait . . . but if you enjoy great food then it is worth the wait . their salads and burgers especially the wine burger w cheese and red onion are fantastic !

0,"it is a cute little restaurant , has a nice wine list . i ordered the linguine with clam sauce , and a glass of pino . personally i think the food is actually pretty good , nice northern italian . but the service was just ok . "
1,great happy hour . get the taco basket ! thursday mexican beer 
0,"good chinese food , great value especially for lunch . china village is one of my regular haunts for chinese food when i m in the neighborhood . the building may look run down , but the food and service are good . "
0,"lets just say i was not to please with my experience at nails r us . after two days my nails were lifting on about nails by the end of the weekend i had nails lifting , so i went back and showed them and she was like its normal . no it normal to lift but not after days ! they did fix them for me free of charge but were very rude to me ! ! ! will not be going back there or will not refer any of my friends there !

0,a very good sandwhich shop ! my boy and i stopped in here after a movie at the amc . they have a neat concept with the bags on the wall where you mark your items . my only wish is that they had cold sandwhiches as well as the toasted variety . i am not always rarely in fact in the mood for a toasted sandwhich . the italian sandwhich i got though was delicious . nom nom nom
1,"top notch . he is now my go to barber . charged only for cut and beard trim , but i throw him a tip on top of that for an exceptional cut . he will ask you questions throughout the cut to make sure you end up with the cut you came for . can t go wrong with this guy . and what a cool place ! "
1,"phoenix has some absolutely amazing italian pizza joints . and when i m in the mood to spend some extra money and wait a while i go to them . but man alive ! red devil is pretty close in terms of quality and it s a lot more laid back . during our last visit , we sat in back . the space has several nice little tucked away areas so everywhere has a nice private feel . our waitress was really nice and accomodating and was with us in just over a minute . some of the fancier drinks were recommended , but we were content with just plain old lemonade . just the right balance of sweet and tangy . the bruschetta arrived quickly fresh out of the oven . the oil and tomatoes were spilling over the top and had a very rich flavor . the italian pizza was just right temperature wise and the green olives added a nice salty kick to the sausage . the prices are reasonable . the staff is great and the pizza is delicious . plus we met a year old in the parking lot who claimed to be a princess . how great is that ?

0,"i used to be a huge fan of the breakfast club , even when i had to wait in the degree heat with a hangover and now i am not . i have had the eggs benedict , the breakfast burrito , and the greek omelet and they are all bland and quite frankly taste the same , even with the red and green sauces on the burrito . i ate there again last weekend because my boyfriend wanted to and i had the lox and bagel , which was down right gross . the salmon was the nastiest color and tasted almost as bad . the bagel , was well , a bagel , but not even a good one at that . next time i am in scottsdale i will be going elsewhere for breakfast , i ll skip the wait and the bad food . "
1,"i stumbled across this place after missing my usual light rail stop on my way to pick up a zipcar at the downtown asu campus . first i tried my usual caffeine fix . . . a nonfat double latte . excellent . second trip back , i gave the breakfast burrito plus bacon a try . delicious . the tortilla was as good as everything inside . third trip , a beet salad and a bacon chocolate chip cookie . bacon and chocolate for the win ! i ve been here three times and have not been disappointed . the decor is modest , but functional , as it should be at a good business with honestly good food . the barista is not only knowledgable and skilled , but is also a genuine sweetheart . it s just a couple of blocks from the jefferson and first street light rail stop east bound , so i ve been stopping by on my way to work .

1,being from sweden you just like salmon and at le chalet you can get a delicous nordique crepe with salmon ! never had anything like that in sweden ! besides the great crepe and friendly service from the owner alain keller i was also treated to a laughing experience . they have a comedy show twice a month . great place to eat and have a nice relaxed evening ! 
1,"what a restaurant ! absolutely loved my experience at tarbells . i ve been hearing rave reviews for quite sometime and decided to try it out recently . my party and i sat at the bar , which was a great choice because the bar was comfortable , rather large and really social and fun . the bartender young woman was fabulous , inviting and very nice ! she was very attentive . a guest in my party dines at tarbells often and she had his drink in front of him by the time we walked to the end of the bar . . . . . now thats some customer service for ya ! food we started with the calamari . a favorite dish of mine and this one was outstanding . two very different but delicious dipping sauces . a roasted red pepper and a pesto mix . not sure which one i liked more i enjoyed the pan seared jumbo sea scallops . to die for . i am a huge scallop fan and these were done just right . caramelized , giving them the right amount a sweet . . . . and it was served over very yummy risotto . another dish enjoyed by my party was the fennel sausage pasta dish , the fennel sausage was amazing . overall experience was fantastic , as soon as i get another opportunity i will be dining here again ! "
1,"love this place . great selection of beers , cheap per beer happy hour , relaxed atmosphere and walking distance to the light rail . some nights they have live music which isn t always to my taste but i like that they provide a venue for local artists and musicians on top of everything else . on first fridays it s packed so good or bad depending on your feeling about crowds i avoid it those nights but on other nights . . . it s just a very cool and comfortable place to hang out . sometimes parking is kind of hard to find .

0,food is just eh . . . just one more sushi place of many
1,"visited this great place last week with my parents and sister and we all had a great time ! the service was a bit in the weeds but everyone was friendly and nice and the food was very good . the tour is worth the and then some , very informative , and our guide was very funny and knew her stuff ! products for sale are lovely and the drive is worthwhile . it is a bit way out but it was different and a great way to spend sunday . gps do not like the address so try google maps and your phone ipad it will get you there . "
1,"i think it was the guitar playing chicken that caught my eye as i drove by . then it was the now open sign . new business ? figured i had to try it . rock n roll fingers is a so cool concept . chicken fingers , waffle fries and texas toast that s pretty much the menu . the chicken fingers may be fried or buffalo style but they definitely won t be from frozen chicken . they use only fresh chicken breasts no skin and no bones and they fry only in canola oil to make for the least unhealthy fried chicken they can . they have about different dipping sauces from ranch to thai sweet chili though they are known for their special sauce . it s a secret recipe , so of course i had to try it . pretty dang good . i also loved the bbq which was more tangy than sweet and went perfect with the chicken . as for the chicken have you ever had chicken so juicy that you though it might not be fully cooked ? maybe it s just because i grew up eating overcooked food , but every once in awhile when i get chicken cooked so perfectly i have to look to make sure it isn t pink . it was so juicy i was really shocked . and though fried , it wasn t a thick and overly crispy batter just enough to seal in the juices while leaving you with a tender and flexible piece of meat . the waffle fries were out of this world . the texas toast was sooo good ! when i got back to the office i was super excited to learn two things . this is an independently owned business this is their first location . and even more cool they have gotten a perfect score by the health department more than six times in a row . wow . so you can eat some really great food and support a new local business for a lunch . not bad . not bad at all . "
1,superb beer selection . music was really nice and at a good volume . really a great place to hang out and have a drink . we missed aka were too tired to stay up past our bedtime a jazz jam session . will have to grab a coffee and hang out next time because i miss me some good jazz . it s so hard to find in phoenix ! 
1,"i really enjoyed dining here . it s a small space inside but plenty of tables outside . the flowers , the exposed beams , large bar great atmosphere . i sat at the bar which is good for dining alone . the bartender is very friendly . i had the foie gras and the pork belly for dinner . the foie gras was ok because the brioche was over powering with to much sweetness . the pork belly is divine . the meat melts in the mouth , and the butternut squash and bacon bits compliment each other very well . the only problem is both dishes are so high in fat and i had to forgo the very popular cream bulee . . . . . . another disappointment is that they don t have an espresso machine and only french press coffee . it s a great spot to stop by when visiting here . great date spot as well .

1,"welcome to the funkiest place in goodyear . if you ve been craving sheet metal winged pigs but regretting that cave creek is practically a day trip from the west valley , you may feel tempted to lie on the floor and weep tears of joy . this armadillo provides fine circuit training for working off breakfast at the black bear diner , including a loft with moderately steep stairs . like its cousin up toward metro center , it s an antique mall in the sense of focusing mostly on vintage items and less uncommon antiques , plus a smattering of collectibles . this is the kind of antique mall i prefer , since it really functions as a sort of fantasy department store for shoppers who have a middle of the road budget but whimsical or retro tastes . like the other armadillo , stock here runs somewhat more to the frilly and ornate than to the mid century modern , but it s not a total lock out of swellness in favor of sweetness . unlike the other one , there s a larger variety of dealers who aren t typical antique mall fare things like reproduction hardware , the aforementioned sheet metal winged pigs , repro tin signs , garden ornaments made from vintage dishes . this isn t my cuppa , but in context , it provides useful variety , and it fills booths there are more empty booths here , but it s still fairly new . a number of dealers seem to actually be replicated here , including the scrapbook store . also replicated is the cheery professionalism of the operation clean restrooms , occasional seating areas , efficient check out , and available snacks . when you re hiking a layout this big , these things come to matter . "
1,"this is one of my new favorites places to bring people who are from out of town . it s something different that i think real foodies will enjoy . although the restaurant itself is dark and cramped , it s worth going to over and over again . i ordered the shepherd s pie pasty , it was very filling and delicious . although i had to wait minutes for it , it was worth waiting for a fresh out of the oven pasty . but if you re ever in a rush , a good thing about this place , is that you can call ahead and request for them to start cooking your pasty so that it is ready to be served once you arrive . "
1,"i love this place . it is one of my favorite antique shops in the city ! there is a wide selection and variety of booths and items . there is everything here from match boxes , cute purses and hats to retro vintage furniture , wacky mannequins , old cameras and old toys to reminiscence over . and ! they are decently priced and have a nice helpful staff . "
0,"this place is a must go if you are some beer starved party animal asu student but as an adult who is one step beyond the let s get blottoed for the sake of getting drunk this place isn t really worth visiting . the beers really aren t that good compared to four peaks papago sun up san tan , or any of the other brew pubs around . really wasn t that impressed with the food either . the only reason i gave it an extra star than one because the service was good , of course there were only one other group in the place at the time .

1," mmmm . this is . a tasty burger . jules . pulp fiction . i like this place , my siblings like this place , and it s the best thing i ve got to remembering better times back home in california . it s a quick fix for people who want good burgers at a decent price . it always hits the spot when i m feeling like a fatty . even considered biking all the way here from my house when my car was dead and going through the drive through . coz the cool kids did it back then . . . in ca anyway haha . and employees didn t care . i agree that drive thru is an atrociously long wait during the afternoon after school . peeps who work here seem pretty chill since i always always , ask them for the hats and throw dozens and dozens of ketchup packets in with my to go orders . biiiiiiiiiiig plus !

1,"love the food here . been here a few times and got the peanut curry twice and been delish . thai iced tea was great as well . only been there during lunch and everything seems pretty good so far . went with coworkers and family and they all loved it too . service was fast , prompt and nice . will be back again to try other dishes .

0,"i had one of the worst experiences of my vegetarian life here . i had been to johnny rocket s before and gotten the vegan option so i knew i would be ok going here . i was out with my meat eating sister and my pescatarian husband so i figured this place would be the best for all three of us to get what we want . we get in and i ordered a burger that wasn t the streamliner st mistake , and just ordered it with the boca burger . the waitress takes our order , my husband also ordered his with a boca . about minutes later the food comes out . the patty looks right . i was a little apprehensive and i should have gone with my gut feeling on not eating here this day , but i ignored it . it had been awhile since i had eaten a boca patty over a year , so i thought it looked right . nd mistake i start eating it and about half way through it the bill hits our table . it was crowded in there so the waitress must have been trying to get us out of there . so i look at the bill and notice both my husband and my burgers say turkey substitution . i immediately start to freak out . we call the waitress over and explain to her that we ordered boca , why does it say turkey ? she then tells us that it is boca it just says turkey . i say , no that doesn t sound right . so she goes to talk to her manager i guess because we never saw her again . the manager comes over to our table and apologizes profusely for what happened . i m upset because how the hell do you confuse boca and turkey ? i mean , really . i know some people might think how did i not know the difference . and i thought that to myself as well , but the truth is it slipped by me even though it shouldn t have . and it hurts me every time i think about it . i will never come to this johnny rockets again , if any of them ever again because of this experience . all i can say is , if you are vegan or vegetarian , and you go to any of the johnny rockets , make sure that your waitress waiter knows that a boca burger isn t meat . stress that to them . because obviously they aren t trained to know what the difference is .

1,postino s in gilbert was stunning ! amazing outdoor indoor chic atmosphere . food and wine were excellent as expected ! what another great addition to the postino family ! loved it ! ! ! ! ! 
0,i have gone here quite a few times . i like having a diner close by for breakfast and newspaper reading . but this one is always short staffed . and there doesn t seem to be much management around to smooth things out . food is usually good but staff always seems stressed out . may be due to serving hoards of poor tipping elderly . 
1,"i ve now been here twice , one to eat in and one to carry out . all in all , great prices , decent service , and semi good food . i ve had the pho when i sat down and ate at the restaurant . not the best i ve had , but at the price , really good and fulfilling . when i ve carried out had the bun thit nuon . great stuff . mi xao and hu tieu xao were just ok . i like that the whole place is very big from a recent expansion , i m reading . the bathrooms are pretty good and the service is not too typical viet actually friendly ish and not too rude brusque . i would come back again for sure . the prices are what you would find in california , so that is just too good to pass up .

1,sakana is one of my two favorite neighborhood sushi joints . i love their calamari salad although the one at this location is considerably smaller than the one on th ave and agedashi tofu . the waitstaff is friendly and their bday song is always fun ! insider s tip ask for some real wasabi ! 
1,this spicy chicken soup is a must have when sick . always makes me feel better when my hubby brings it home for me . 
1,"sure the food is good , but out of my last take out orders they got it right maybe once . the people making the food look so high you would think you were at cheba hut , but i just love that damn broccoli and wisconsin cheese soup ! their fresh dark rye bread is always great . i enjoy the italian quite a bit and the wife loves their tuna salad . great healthy place for food if they aren t too high to get your order right .

0,monday evening at p . . . . the streets are empty . . . . we walk into the bar looking for a happy hour beer while we wait for a yelp event to get started a few doors down . noticing a couple of people on the sidewalk we expected more people inside . . . . crickets chirping [you d hear them if it wasn t for a few of the tvs that had their volume turned up . ] the interior was welcoming and clean . . . but why are we the only ones here . . . the bartender was rather indifferent and sauntered over like he was wishing he could be somewhere else too . we had a leisurely beer and tabbed out . . . . i may have to check out this place again if i find myself in the area .

1,only three stars ? wow maybe it was the ambiance that sucks overall here i don t know . i actually didn t go here myself . it was my wife . she brought me home a cheese enchilada plate and it hit the spot even lukewarm . all i know is that meal was better as a leftover than a lot of the fresh ones i ve had at taquerias around the tri city area . makes me wonder how it would taste if it were nice and hot . . . okay challenge accepted . i ll let you know . 
0,"walking in to five guys , i was rather excited , and was looking forward to my experience . i have never been to a five guys before , so this was something new . my first reaction upon opening the doors was the music was blaring . too loud , at least . the music was classic rock , which i don t mind . after walking up and reviewing the easily understood menu and waiting in line for a few minutes , someone took our order . the order taker seemed like she was having a long day , not seeming very interested in the customer . while taking the order , one could clearly see the kitchen . it seemed kind of like in n out , but everyone was moving much slower . it was as if everyone was moving in slow motion . much to my dismay , they did not offer dr . pepper , my favorite soft drink . i was surprised that they offered other lesser known drinks , but not dr . pepper ? come on . after waiting about or minutes , my food arrived in a bag . a bag ? really ? i was planning on eating inside , not take out . even mcdonald s does better than that . digging through the bag i first took out the fries , which were in a cup , and i took a bite . my first impression of the fries was they were nothing special , and too salty . i like salt on my fries as it adds flavor , but there was simply too much salt . as a result , in addition to the fact that the serving was quite large , i finished only about half of my fries . now onto the burger . i paid about for my meal , so i was thinking to myself that this better be the best burger i have ever tasted in a long time . unwrapping the product in its tin foil wrapping , i noticed that the presentation of the burger was sub par . the burger did not look appetizing , at all . almost disgusting , as a matter of fact . the cheese was dripping over the bun , and i couldn t even see all the ingredients on the burger . taking my first bite , it didn t taste bad . a pretty classic american burger taste , i must say . it did taste rather close to wendy s . upon finishing my meal , i was not impressed . my stomach felt greasy , and i felt the need to go hike a mountain a couple times , which i did , as tempe butte is close by . i felt my stomach almost on the point of rejecting it , it was that greasy . seriously . overall , five guys is way to expensive , unbelievably greasy , and makes your stomach cringe . the atmosphere is nice though , thus the two stars . if you had to choose between five guys and in n out , ino is the clear winner in every category .

1,"i was sworn to secrecy when we first came here with friends several years ago . i think it s some of the best italian in town . it isn t fancy a plus , in my book . it s small , so sometimes there can be a wait involved . even though its small , because of the very personal service by the owner , the service can be lacking or distracted . the food , however , is well worth it ! i try to get something new each time i go , and i ve never been disappointed .

1,carlsbad tavern is my favorite mexican restaurant . i love the dark and cozy atmosphere inside and i love that they have hoegaarden on tap . . i ve had the machaca burrito and fish tacos here and both dishes were amazing . they serve new mexico cuisine here . the only difference i noticed is they are big on green chile and use black beans instead of refried beans . i have a lot of friends from new mexico and they all love this restaurant . the food here is delicious and flavorful if you don t live in the neighborhood it s definitely worth the drive . 
1,"i m so happy this store is located so close to my house ! every time i come to this store i get great service . i mainly use this store to get food items for my dog or the grooming salon where zombi has never had a bad experience . this location also has a banfield vet hospital , petshotel , doggie day camp , training services and at times has adoptions . my best friend has used both the petshotel and the doggie day camp for her pooch and has never had a bad experience . i also used the banfield vet to get zombi up to date on her rabies and the vet was super nice . the best part was that i didn t even have an appointment , i just walked in and they were able to fit me in after a five minute wait . my only pet peeve pun intended is there is usually only one cashier working and the line can get pretty long . however , it doesn t take long for another employee to open up another line to speed up the check out experience and they usually show up on their own , without customers complaining about only having one cashier . bonus !

1,"what a beautiful brunch oasis in downtown phoenix . sitting outside on an april afternoon , listening to jazz and feeling the cool breeze thanks to the misters , i felt like i was in the mediterranean by the sea . or something like that . anyway , i really dug the atmosphere , and the food was delicious . the vegetarian omelet was yummy , bursting with veggies , and the olives gave it a great flavor . the potatoes were perfectly cooked and seasoned , and the whole wheat bread was thick and perfectly toasted . i also had a few bites of the banana fosters french toast , which is waaaaay too sweet , in my opinion , to be considered breakfast food but was a great finish to my meal . the coffee is good enough to drink black .

0,"met a few friends here for happy hour . they had martinis , but that s not what i ended up getting . they have a drink special everyday . that day they had the walter crankite , i think ! it was like an appletini with cranberry juice . we didn t order anything else . the service was great . our servere was very attentive .

1,"finally tried the only real chinese food restaurant in maricopa . played it safe with sweet sour chicken , crab rangoon , and pork fried rice . with delivery , it was only tip . the fried rice was great , it was a little more of the east coast style i grew up with , dark w lots of juicy nuggets of roast pork . the chicken was good , but then again , it was a very safe choice , next time i ll try one of the chef s specialties . crab rangoon was good , unlike panda express , there was crab krab ? in the cream cheese . if you re in maricopa and craving chinese , don t go to panda express , definitely give great wall a try , it s in the same plaza as panda and if your party is or more , you ll save yourself some money !

1,"for a brewery type restaurant they do a pretty good job , in fact mabe the best one in town for me . most of these type of places do a very mediocre jobs with a very extensive menu . bj s has a great gluten free options . the pizza is very good , probably the best i ve had in town . good selection of beers . service is always pretty good .

1,"yay i am a fan . . . ok for the ladies . . . this is a tough bit , i have shopped here with girls who literally will hide good finds in other places of the store so they can come back and get them later , most of the time they are gone . funny huh , this place literally looks worse then some of the barrio shops in rocky point , it seems like it is the day after thanksgiving every day there , and people literally throw stuff anywhere . for the guys this place is a pretty good place to go , the deals on shoes are unreal , nikes that are . bucks for like . , you can t get that anywhere . you can also get top notch clothing and make you look like a true scottsdale deuschbag for less then bucks rolex or tag heur watches will not be found here , sorry deuschbaggery only goes so far at last chance . in any event this is probably one of the best bargain basement places in the valley to get top notch stuff . two things you need to know about this place . . they restock every sunday , so sunday mornings here really are like every black friday after thanksgiving , you might get trampled to death like that guy at walmart or shot like those two dudes at toy s r us . . and it could be your last chance . check all your shit seriously , allot of this stuff is here because it is damaged , so be careful they have no return policy that is why it is last chance !

1,"fantastic pizza for the price ! one of our favorite take out spots . ask for the daily special as you can usually get wings , soda and pizza for the price of a large pizza . great deals , great prices and quick service . not a place to go sit and eat strictly take out . "
0,"i wasn t really very impressed . bajio isn t bad by any stretch , but it s certainly nothing to really rave about . the prices were a little steep for what you get and everything keep in mind , this is mexican food was oddly sweet for some reason . . . and that struck me oddly . burritos and such , served in a very chipotle esque fashion , but for a few bucks more than chipotle . i don t believe i ll be returning . not because it was a negative experience , just exceptionally meh .

1,"had to write a quick review to this place . it kicks denny s ass . the food is always done well , eggs made to order , fries always hot and crispy . sandwiches are full of good , fresh ingredients , breakfasts are all delish . waitresses are a good sweet salty combo . my friend made a side comment the last time about wanting my pickle , because she had breakfast and i had a sammy . the waitress , without a word , came back to the table with a plate of the crisp briny spears . nice xtra touch ! all in all a pleasant , cheap , laid back , diner , which is damn hard to come by in this day and age .

1,"we live in the neighborhood so were excited to see a new place with a huge range of beers open up . the decorations are a bit sparse , but we like to sit on the patio or the conversation areas near the bar , which are perfect this time of year . yucca chips are personal favorites , as is the gnocchi bolognese . burger wasn t bad , but a burger is just a burger . they re still adjusting their menu it seems , which i expect any place to do for the first few weeks as they settle in . i really love their commitment to craft beer , especially arizona beers . pitchers of az beer before is not only quite a tasty offering , but appeals to my love of all things local . give ohso a try !

1,amazing sandwhich joint . a must go place to eat ! 
1,"this is a bit far from us , but we went and we had a great time . i loved browsing the local goods , and the fact that it s pet friendly was a huge plus in our book . the old lady who our dog sniffed , on the other hand , should probably take a chill pill . i also got a great bunch of fresh basil from this place , which had excellent aroma and taste .

1,"i had such a great time at this place both times i went . the first visit was a sushi dinner extravaganza with my sister . the place was literally a minute walk from my childhood home , where my parents still live , which was the first bonus for this place . once i walked in my excitement grew . the place was small and intimate although a bit on the hot side . our waitress spoke with a heavy japanese accent and she was very friendly . we ordered a bunch of rolls , they have a fairly small selection of rolls which is fine with me , and some nigiri . they even had uni ! i dont know how it is in phoenix but i live in salt lake city and uni is incredibly hard to find there for some unknown reason . anyways the sushi was well prepared and tasted very fresh . their yellowfin was just amazing ! my next visit was a lunch with my mother a few days later and we ate mostly non sushi offerings which were also very good . i had yakisoba which was delicious and my mother had the bento box with teriyaki steak which was also fantastic . this place is a real gem and for me personally the location is perfect . "
0,"i had very high expectations for the breakfast joynt because so many gave it stars , which means as good as it gets , woohoo ! according to yelp . my experience didn t live up to that but i m willing to give them another try . this location was formerly a bar that was transformed into a breakfast restaurant . the actual bar is still there , with a flat panel tv in the middle , but surprisingly the shelves are still empty all the way up to the ceiling . they ve only been there around months , so maybe this will change as they settle into the location . it has a very clean , upscale feel to it something not out of place in north scottsdale . it s also easy to find once you re off the onto raintree , and then north on northsight . . . it s on the right and shares parking with gold s gym that is easily seen from the road . i found the eggs to be good , and recommend steering towards the omelet choices . being from the south , it wasn t thrilling that the biscuits were somewhat small and square shaped , almost like a little dinner roll . they have their own style and they ve informed me that they are homemade but i was looking for something more substantial to be smothered in sausage gravy . the pancakes were not served hot with the other food items , and they seemed to have settled and were somewhat chewy and elastic . menu was rather straightforward and clear with sectioned boxes , with a nice highlight of their featured stuffed apple pancake . i thought the description of ham that falls off the bone was repeated far too many times . prices were very reasonable for scottsdale . the fresh squeezed orange juice was excellent . owners are very concerned about customers with less than a stellar dining experience , so i ll be sure to give the breakfast joynt another try with friends and family .

1,"roka akor scottsdale is an extension of the celebrated roka in london . i attended the opening night and a follow up for lunch the following day . overall , i was impressed with the offerings of fresh sushi , and robata grilled tidbits . the dish that really won me over was crab hot pot and the creamy rice was absolutely zoftik . i drank many fresh sochu infused cocktails , and crushed three bottles of sake with skilled kikisake shi , sayaka watanabe . this japanese sake sommelier is london based and the zuma roka group sake trainer . they do have a fantastic sake selection . easily the best in scottsdale . she loved my sake brand i created with midorikawa called green river , and my low alcohol brand sake , koide , as well . they also have a great italian sommelier named alessandro marchesan , who is also based out of london . too bad they are only loaner personnel from hq in london . the room is clean and beautiful with post modern asian inspired lines . the staff is eager and young , but quite unskilled in refined service . i am sure that will be a long cycle for the roka management to fix . i have a dear friend who dined there on her birthday . she told me the service was shockingly bad . she then reiterated that is was , so bad that it was entertainingly bad ! the food great and hopefully the service will match soon . kanpai , roka . . kudos on your sake program .

0,"not a great experience last night at eastwind . i m going to start this by saying that i ve been eating here for over years , when it was tokyo express and now eastwind . i was a customer weekly when i lived closer , now it s every days or so . we went for dinner around and it took way too long to get seated in the half empty restaurant . we were seated next to a family that must have been friends or family with one server , as she was constantly at their table . she was there while we were waiting and obviously saw us before finally showing us to a table . our server was a guy that must have been new , as he seemed very nervous and didn t know the menu . so we ordered the sushi sampler for me and the korean beef and a veggie roll for her . i got the sushi , but not the salad and soup that it comes with . the veggie roll turned into an egg roll . everything came at once , and the server didn t make his return until we were done . after consulting with server , he took off the egg roll and our drink . guess that s supposed to make up for it . . . .

1,"i am not one to hang out in downtown phoenix before or after an event because quite frankly it s boring . however , when i visited copper blues on prior to the comedy show next door i will definitely be hanging out after events . here s why . . . they have a live band and over sixty beers on tap . it s a nice cozy environment especially if you sit outside . budweiser drafts were only and soda was only . we didn t try their food but i hear the same owner owns both copper and stand up live so i am sure the kitchen is the same so i am confident in saying that the food is delicious because it was at stand up live . happy hour is pm to pm sun thurs so its basically perfect when any event is taking place during on those days . on this satuday night people were having a good time . the draft beer was perfect and fresh . the music was good and the bartender was real friendly and answered all of our questions cheerfully . we had such a great time that me and my wife are going back to copper blues on to hang out and drink with friends prior to our comedy show next door . this is a nice spot and you have to check it out especially if you are going to the show next door !

1,"i liked this place . . . because it s a local owned place with delicious greasy food . this place was written up in the east valley trib in one of their to try pieces , which is where i first heard about it . but , i actually think it s funnier that i have been in hall of fame , a store located direclty next door several times and never given giant hamburgers a second glance . you walk into this place , past a grouping of tables and booths only about tables in the entire place to the cash register where you order your meal . we each got a burger and fries and they were both great , a real gut bomb , but sometimes you re in the mood for something that fits just that description . we sat and ate , and they came to bus our table for us . on the way out , we noticed the yelp sticker on the door . bonus points .

0,"i don t really get what all the buzz is about . coming from socal i think in n out has this place beat . i can get a small burger and small fries from five guys and i am beyond full the rest of the day . the cajun fries are ok but i kind of freak out when the bag carrying your food gets stained from all of the grease . why i m giving three stars instead of two is that i just discovered their hot dogs and those are fantastic . i never need to have another burger from here , i ll stick with my double doubles . . . . . . but the hot dogs ? ? ? ? voila ! ! ! ! and their soda machine is really cool too . it s touch screen so once you pick your soda , you then get to add flavors . it s really cool . if they had a soda machine on the starship enterprise , it would be the soda fountain from five guys . . . . except that it would have to be voice command . anyway , i ll be back for the weiners and to play with the soda machine"

1,"i have no idea why i haven t dined or noshed during happy hour at this place more often , i ve always had great service , great wine , and great food . there is no adequate excuse , but anyway , my third adventure here made me update my review to stars because th and wine has earned it . the wines by the glass range from unless you come in before pm then they are only ! those prices alone should make you want to come here for drinks with friends . the servers have always been cool with offering samples if you can t make up your own mind between two wines despite the recommendation from the server and your friend saying just pick one ! . due to this fact , i ve always had a glass that i have enjoyed , which is usually a zinfandel . i have now had the pleasure of experiencing all of their different types of bruschetta . my top two favorites are the prosciutto , mascarpone , figs , and tomato jam which has a great combination of salty and sweet , and the apples , brie , and fig jam one which is on the sweeter side , but not overwhelming because the bread and the tart granny smith apple slices help balance out the flavor . the chopped salad is very light and refreshing option to accompany the brushcetta appetizer . th and wine is also a restaurant so other food options are available , i have sampled the chicken and pesto pasta which has a delicious cream sauce and their mac cheese which is super rich with the two types of melted cheese , but both items are delicious . the atmosphere is great whether you are sitting inside or outside . the lighting is soft , giving more of an intimate feel , yet this place still remains simple and casual , which i love . the outside patio is great , it is a courtyard that offers peeks into store windows while remaining private from the traffic of old town . the times i have been here it has never been super crowded and i am able to just walk in and be seated right away . th and wine still feels like a hidden gem and you must try it out !

0,"i so wanted to love this place . i d heard great things about the food , love the concept and was looking forward to a wonderful experience . what a disappointment . we were seated within minutes or so of arrival , which was great considering the crowd . it was nice to have somewhere to walk around , and we were able to serve ourselves tea and coffee while we waited . once seated , however , it took minutes for anyone to take our order , and another for the food to come . our food arrived cold . husband and i both ordered eggs over medium mine were runny and undercooked , his were hard and scaly . home fries were a mound of mushy , under seasoned potatoes . we were offered jam when the food came , but the waitress never returned with it . my husband asked one of the other staff if they had any jam , received a curt , yes as a reply , but they didn t offer to help in any way . for the prices average plus . for a self serve drink , i can think of many places i d rather spend my dining dollars . yes , the grounds are lovely and i like that most of the food is from local suppliers which does not mean it was raised on this farm , btw , but there are many lovely patios in phoenix with much better food and service .

1,"the new , old el chorro lodge has been reopened for all of two days , and a friend of a friend managed to secure a reservation during their soft opening , so i got an opportunity to check it out . i was impressed , but not blown away . everything i tasted was quite competent , but if i had to choose a word to describe the menu , i would suggest staid . perhaps even stodgy , but that may be more harsh than i intend . review the dinner menu . http bit . ly awqvvj . there , see what i mean ? replete with traditional american entrees and sides , at what i would consider fairly exorbitant prices . i would say that i wouldn t go back to eat this food at these prices , unless someone else was paying . i should note that a big part of why i wasn t impressed is because this place is simply not my style . the wait staff , attired in khakis and blue shirts , was a little too informal for the prices we were paying , i felt . the menu options were a little boring for my taste . the cocktail menu is exactly not what i m looking for these days , although i will be very interested to see what happy hour looks like . the decor is a tad heavy on the old southwest theme , although to be fair , this place not only pulls it off rather stylishly but also is among the most authentically old and southwestern establishments in the phoenix metro area . the patio and open bar are fantastic . the bar area is considerable , and the patio is palatial up above lincoln dr enough to be fairly quiet , with a gorgeous view of camelback , sunset here must be incredible . anyway , back to the food . everything was very well executed , from the sticky buns we were served upon being seated to the desserts we ordered . i chose the soup of the day to start , a tomato basil concoction that was quite hearty and thoroughly enjoyed it . the salads my dining companions ate looked boring to me , but they all claimed them to be excellent , with the best caesar dressing ever and polenta croutons ? ! ? being the verdict for the caesar salad , at least . on to the entrees . i ordered the crispy duck , which i found to be delicious and quite hearty , though not what i would call crispy by any means . it was a very sizable portion , and very well prepared . my dining companions ordered the pork chop , the lamb , and the salmon , and we each sampled from each other s plates . i would try the lamb if i went back , but the consensus seemed to be that everything was very well prepared , with the duck being a winner . it was served with a heap of mushy sweet potatoes just like my mom makes at thanksgiving delicious ! and red cabbage , which i sampled and declined to finish . again , not quite my style . we moved on to dessert sticky bread pudding with a bourbon glaze and the warm chocolate cake . the bread pudding was a winner at the first two or three bites , but grew one dimensional as i continued nibbling at it . the chocolate cake was decadent , among the best i ve ever tasted . it was clearly made with a considerable amount of dark chocolate , which seals the deal for me . and in case you were wondering , my dining companions apparently have no stamina when it comes to dessert . suckers . anyway , as i ve said now several times , this place is just not quite me . it s totally classy and very high in quality , but not quite adventurous enough for my taste . i d love to come back for brunch , and once they unveil their happy hour menu , i m sure i ll be back to check it out , but i won t be back for dinner unless i can convince someone else to pick up the check at the end of the evening . as a side note , this place is so very paradise valley . it s a welcome relief knowing that there is a place that is so anti scene out there . it s been a little while since i ve been both the youngest and among the poorest in a room , and i will say it was a little comforting . just don t tell the scottsdale people about this place , and we ll all be happy .

1,"while i am giving this restaurant four stars , i must start off by noting that the pizza here is mediocre . if you want spectacular pizza in phoenix , don t kid yourself that it s at i and thomas . it s over at pizzeria bianco . however , the other items on the dinner menu are worthy of a visit to the hood . the penne alla vodka . offers up pasta in tomato sauce with bacon , fresh basil cream and vodka . it is an excellent starter to split with a dining companion and that s exactly what the bf and i do every time we visit this place . the cozze posolipo mussels in garlic white wine sauce . are also quite tasty as an appetizer . the complimentary warm pizza dough they serve with an onion and olive topping is a nice touch . for entrees , the pollo parmigiana . is the classic breaded chicken breast with marinara , mozzarella and parmesan cheese served with penne . the lasagna della casa with bolognese sauce . is very good , but the portion is a bit stingy for the price . the bf often enjoys the gamberi alla pana . that includes jumbo shrimp saut ed with mushrooms in a brandy cream sauce over a bed of fettuccine . please note that the brandy cream sauce is extremely rich . another tasty option is the spaghetti con salsiccia . with mushrooms , bell peppers , onions and italian sausage in marinara sauce with a touch of white wine . the cheese ravioli . is another great choice with the tomato cream sauce . for dessert , be sure to order a cannoli siciliani . as it s the very best i have had in phoenix . the tiramisu . is good as well . the bad news is that this place is no longer byob . for whatever reason , the management decided that a restaurant that seats no more than needed a full liquor license . i really hope that the investment in that spendy license doesn t lead to the undoing of this place . given that they don t even have a bar area and i almost never see anyone order a mixed drink , i think staying byob might have been a better choice for this neighborhood joint . the service at this place is also part of the show . the waiter may well be manic as he will either be way up or way down for your visit . the d cor here is pleasant enough given the location of this tiny restaurant in a modest strip mall . if you happen to need a trip to the restroom , you will get the chance to traipse through the kitchen . all in all , pizza a metro is ironically a great option for everything but pizza .

0,"my sister recently took her vw new beetle to first class auto in scottsdale , az for an overheating issue . i m normally the one who does the maintenance on the vehicle but i was miles away . she described the symptoms as follows overheating light came on while she was stuck in construction traffic and went back off once she was moving again . i immediately suggested that the radiator fans may not be coming on for some reason . since i wasn t around to look at it , she took it to first class auto . she relayed the symptoms to the guys at first class and also specifically requested they check radiator fan functionality . they told her the water pump was cracked and leaking , needed a new thermostat and also replace the timing belt and serpentine belt while they were in there water pump is driven by the timing belt on this engine . l v cyl aeg code . well , a i personally replaced the timing belt , water pump and serpentine belt about , miles ago as preventative maintenance . what s more is the car hasn t lost any coolant since the job . so the water pump being cracked is highly unlikely ! i did not replace the thermostat , though . once she called me to tell me this , i told her to decline the work and either take it somewhere else or wait for me to make a trip out . i had a job to do that brought me almost half way to the phoenix area so i decided i would make the trip the rest of the way to have a look for myself yesterday . first thing i did was check the radiator fans . i turned on the ac and the fans didn t come on at all . i pop the cover off the strip fuse panel that resides on top of the battery and found a melted amp fuse . guess what that fuse is for ? the radiator fans ! imagine that . being a car that lived most of its life in michigan , some of the fuses and the fuse panel itself had become corroded and caused the one fuse and part of the fuse panel to melt . the coolant level was exactly at the max level , right where it was after i did the maintenance on it , miles ago , not to mention i checked it before her recent trip to scottsdale didn t have to add anything . the car doesn t leak a drop of coolant . local dealer had a new fuse panel in stock , i swapped it out and replaced all of the amp blade fuses as they were all corroded pretty badly . the larger strip fuses were still decent . the radiator fans now work as normal and the car does not overheat . the hose coming off the thermostat also becomes pressurized and hot at the correct temperature as well , so that s definitely not a problem ! fans also come on automatically once the coolant temp hits deg celsius like they re supposed to . problem solved ! i drove down to first class auto today to give them a chance to explain defend themselves , but there was only one guy working in the shop who she didn t recognize and no one at the counter . what great customer service ! so she could have spent the quoted and still had the same problem ! she just got dinged for a diagnostic fee . . . for an incorrect diagnosis .

0,"abridged i m gonna be real with you . i am not in love with pizzeria bianco , and had i actually had to wait in line , this rating would probably be lower . my group was lucky enough to receive the last table without any wait . maybe it was the fact that it s hard to impress me with pizza . maybe it was a fluke that won t happen again . at least that s what everyone keeps telling me . but honestly , i just wasn t that impressed with the pizza i received . sadly , the leftovers i took home ended up being tossed because i was afraid to try it again . i ve been worried about writing this for awhile it s been sitting here unfinished for nearly a year , but in the end , my opinions haven t changed , and i sit here , still scared to return . if someone dragged me there again , or had a party there or something , i d probably give it another shot , as i hate to write off any place after a single trip , but i honestly felt just eh about the whole thing . thankfully none of my visiting out of town guests have cried for me to take them there .

0,"i m torn with cream . i ve been to the usual clubs and lounges in scottsdale enough to be sick of them , and cream was something new . i like that cream is emulating vegas style nightclubs , but it s obviously trying too hard . the decor first of all , this place is painfully tiny . i ve only been here once , and while it was half full , so it wasn t completely unbearable . but i can t imagine what it must be like when they have guest djs and other performers in . a tiny place that s packed isn t popular . it s just . . . small . the walls are covered in white leather ? , the tiles are white , everything is white i get it , white like cream ? i appreciate the commitment to the color but the theme is waaay off . the hard surfaces make the place look cold and very hospital like i would have liked to see more smooth lines and softness in the design , more flowy like cream . the atmosphere the dig the loud music and the techno . i get so sick of hearing the same stupid songs on the radio . i love the change in scene . phoenix scottsdale is so stale in terms of music . this is a nice change . but it s too loud when you can t even put an order in for your drink . i literally had to pull myself onto the bar i m tiny , so i could give my order directly into the bartender s ear . they also had a really cool entertainment act a girl hung from a hoop suspended from the ceiling wearing a white bikini . she was clearly talented in her hoop manipulating and was mesmerizing to watch , but like i said , this place is tiny , and there were several instances in which she was inches away from kicking people in the face . and that would have been worth the ridiculous cover i didn t pay i try to find any way not to . the drinks overpriced and terrible . maybe the bartender thought she heard me say i wanted a glass of vodka piss , because that s what it tasted like . i doubt there will be any improvements made that will make me like cream better , but here s hoping .

1,"this hd is very good . they seem to have knowledgeable people . when i was putting in my irrigation system a while back i got a lot of good info from their plumbing guy . apparently he was a master plumber . on this trip i needed a overheat sensor for a can light . the lighting guy had a can he said he couldn t sell because it was missing something , and proceeded to rip the sensor out for me . no charge . that s customer service !

1,"one word to describe this hotel quality . the pools were all warm and unique . the hotel has two hot tubs , one that changes colors at night and is next to a man made stream , the other is on its own island . there are two pools , a lazy river , and a small pool . the rooms were comfortable and the whole facility was clean . one thing that must be commented on is the staff was not only efficient but they were very friendly and nice . all of the food and room service i ordered was filled with superb flavor and had good presentation . the hotel also has a botanical garden , herb garden , multiple lawns , and it contains different food services . i highly recommend the ranchero pulled pork tacos and the sushi . the marriott burger , creme br l e , drinks , and fromage board was very good .

1,"went here for dinner tonight . service was great . they still bring out the plate of pickles , but now they also brought slices of challah bread and rolls the onion one is awesome . i had the vegetarian delight sandwich . very tasty . the vegetable cream cheese on the sandwich was excellent . huge portions . the tomato soup was good as well , but not as good as the soup at bravi . i tasted some of the onion strings . delicious . they had a dipping sauce that was a bit spicy . it was good too . my husband got aaron s choice some kind of pastrami corned beef sandwich . he liked it , but prefers miracle mile . overall a good dining experience , and i got some bagels to go !

0,"would have been stats based on prior visit . this past visit the service was just garbage . not the servers fault , she should have never been on the floor in the first place . pretty annoyed that she had to ask other servers for assistance while taking our order . what s the soup ? i don t know , jim what s the soup ? is there cheese on the french dip . i don t know ? karen is there cheese on the french dip ? the food has always been great and we will be back . hopefully i can give them stars next visit ? oh yeah , love the . new location !

1,"i entered the cpk world late in life , and i m sad about it because , apparently , i ve been missing out . cpk is great ! contrary to what i thought , it s not just a place for pizza . although the place can suit all sorts of tastebuds , i would recommend going just for the pizza . i went this evening for the second time in two weeks and ordered the bbq chicken chopped salad . it maybe could ve used a little more dressing , but it was still good , so i can t complain too much . when i went last week , i ordered one pizza from the many great options available , and i have to say , there is a reason it is called the california pizza kitchen and not the california salad or pasta kitchen . so yay ! i m a fan . of the pizza here . the other stuff . . . . meh . the servers are always pleasant here , and i never wait a long time for the food to come out . prices are what you would expect for a chain restaurant . parking isn t usually a problem unless there s an event going on at tempe marketplace . the up side to eating at this particular location is that you can browse the shopping area before you stop in or after you re done eating . be forewarned if you are ever asked if you want avocado with your salad , and you say yes , you will be charged extra . look out for this sneak attack .

0,"i prefer petsmart better because they have a better selection and prices . i like petco for their cookie bar so i can pick up some cookies that are friendly for pets for my pets . that s basically it , i only shop here on occasion because of the location . go to pets inc in tempe instead for a real shopping experience .

0,"i was so , so hopeful . october in scottsdale , yummy , tacos . . . . . wow ! rip off ! ! just to get in what was that for ? . no shade unless you were buying a drink . most places wouldn t give you salsa or taco sauce with your measly over priced taco . they seemed like the vultures who didn t care about the customer , just the ticket they could grab from you . i had to beg for a napkin then hunt for a place to sit feeling watched by the other vultures waiting for me to get up . i was ready to leave after minutes and my pepsi had gotten warm , so i had gotten a cup of ice from the bar . i poured it in , took one drink and as i was leaving to hike back to my car , security stopped me and would n t let me take it out ! it could have booze in it . well , by then , i was one angry little local . dumped it all in trash and said to my sweet daughter in law who was about to go mad with me , get me outta here ! . she had brought her year old , thinking what a fun way to spend a saturday morning and encourage our local businesses . nope . not good .

1,"i like that we have a sports venue in the west valley , i think that this place has tons of more potential but under the current recession it will take time to recover and get the growth we need all around this place . i love that cabelas is over here and movie theaters nearby . i enjoy the food options when we are in this area and sometimes drive out of my way to come here since park west is also nearby on northern . we came here this weekend and the kids walked around with us and we enjoy all the fountains and the kid area where children can play in the water .

1,"i heard about this little gem earlier in the week , and after looking at the menu online and reading some reviews from fellow yelpers , i decided i would try it out . the restaurant was very clean and i enjoyed the music playing , but i think it could use a little more color in the dining room . i was greeted upon entering and was asked if i had been here before . the waiter was very friendly and took the time to explain some of the dishes to me . i asked about the pof pof and he explained that they are like donuts , but better . i passed on them . i ordered the jerk steak over jolof rice , a meat patty , and plantains . first came out the meat patty . the pastry tasted like cornmeal to me , and not flakey like i had hoped . the filling was quite good and just enough spice without going overboard . the steak was very tender and flavorful , with a little bit of heat . for the price , you get your money s worth and i ll have enough left overs for tomorrow s lunch . before leaving , the waiter gave me a complimentary pof pof , and in my opinion , it was better than a donut . i ll definitely be going there again . john h"
0,"i tasted my first qdoba burrito last night . i went with the queso steak burrito . the burrito was hearty with lots of meat , rice and beans topped off with pico and some cheese and sour cream . my wife enjoyed her chicken burrito bowl with similar ingredients . i ve had many burritos from taquerias to the burrito chains . qdoba falls somewhere in the middle . i would gladly take a qdoba burrito over a chipotle or una mas burrito any day based on my initial experience . the staff was friendly and we were in and out for our take out order within minutes .

1,"ok . . . . my nd review of an irish pub . and we re getting closer . good ambiance i really thought it looked much like a few pubs i visited in dublin tho no pictures , that i saw , of the famous revolutionaries , no flags , no old photographs . but a good draft beer selection . and a really good irish menu we had the fish sandwich and the banger sandwich lunch menu which included chips french fries and i ordered a side of curry dip for the chips . good stuff . good irish music cd s playing in the background not obtrusive . and a very good wait staff . the bartender greeted us the minute we walked in . but sorry , folks , music is thurs thru sat and no irish music that they admitted to cover bands instead . so i ll keep looking , but i ll stop here when i m in the neighborhood .

1,"so , i avoided this place like the plague for the longest time . no reason really , it just never caught my attention . it always seemed to be empty , which led me to believe it must not be that great . well , don t judge a book until you walk in and try the spaghetti ! the bollo neapolitan has been my favorite pasta so far and the steak sandwich is to die for . i m telling you i never order steak sandwiches and i fell in love ! i ve tried a few of the other pastas and they were ok , but the bollo neapolitan was my fav with the runner up being the garlic shrimp pasta . now for the negatives . the chicken on the pasta just never really tastes right to me . i don t know what it is , but it has a very gamey taste . the dishes i ve tried without chicken have been far superior in my view . finally , i ve never seen this place packed . that can be a negative or a positive depending on my mood , but i would like to see a few more patrons . so , if you don t want to wait in line at the other italian joint in the amc complex macaroni grill or are looking for a non chain option , check out neapolitan ! the service has always been great too . bottom line i m glad to finally have a decent italian choice when going to the movies at amc .

1,"upon suggestion of the scottsdale native , i landed here one night for dinner . this place is part of fox restaurant concepts group who is also responsible for culinary dropout , wildflower , modern steak , zin burger , sauce , montana avenue , bloom among others . atmosphere awesome . very happening , trendy with mostly young professional and older folks . huge place with big open space . great for groups with long table seating either booth or traditional table or couch . the wall opens up to the outdoor patio where you can sit on couches . we sat inside since it was a bit chilly . food latin mexican inspired menu . huge portions ! . complimentary chips salsa didn t have any chips as i like to usually eat my salsa by spoon since it s lower calorie that way . good flavor , nothing spectacular . wish it were a bit more chunkier . . fish tacos the native and i split this dish and it was brought out split for us . it was like entrees ! i m glad we split this since it was a ton of food . the dish came with rice , pinto beans choice of black beans as well . mini fish tacos with grilled fish , avocado , pico de gallo . very yummy . always a fan of the grilled food even though it increases your colon cancer risk . . crab and shrimp ceviche containing cucumber , avocado , radish . nice flavors . not memorable however so there not much to write here . . . . . simply because i can t remember . . . . . i know it wasn t bad though . service no complaints here . attentive enough . parking private lot . no problems finding a spot . conclusion i think i would come here again more for the atmosphere but food is good too !

0,"i was way excited to try this restaurant since it s so close to my house . i just assumed it was one of those places that looked like a dive outside , but served up a piece of heaven inside . once i read the yelp reviews , i was convinced i had made a sound real estate investment ! maybe my expectations hopes were too high , but i thought it was just ok . i liked the chips and salsa , and the service was friendly without being in your face . we ordered a round of margaritas which tasted good , but were really weak in terms of the amount of tequila . my father had the garlic shrimp and octopus which was really delicious if i go back this is what i d order and i had the fish cuilichi was ok , just kinda heavy and not really something that got me excited . the girly girl in me says , not worth the calories ! i think i ll give it another try some time in the future perhaps it was an off night .

1,"if it s an emergency , they will generally see you asap . when we used to live in desert ridge , we had dogs , cats , there were times when i needed a vet immediately , and generally they will accommodate you in such a demise . they see you pretty efficiently , but of course they will suggest things that i feel are not merited to add onto a bill , but it s your right to question their additions and refuse , of course . i ve never found them to be arrogant or pushy , they will easily offer other options , or be ok with your decision . during extremely difficult period with our beloved rottie sheppard mix , they were very understanding to the emotional distress we were experiencing with regards to his advancing old age he was . they were happy to provided us with care during his aging . sadly , it came to a point that his quality of life was no longer conducive to allowing him to continue in the state he was , and it when it came to making the horrible and very sad decision to allow them to put him down , the entire staff were so understanding , caring , and totally sympathetic to our demise . they allowed us to hold him , cradle him and pet him the whole time . we were allowed as much time as we wanted before , during and after the whole life altering circumstance . they even sent us a sympathy card , signed by all the staff , after the terrible ordeal we went through . during another trying experience we had to endure , our boxer mix was attacked by another dog and needed emergency care . we were now closer , and under the care of the tatum shea location , but they were unable to see us . this location was able to open up their schedule to see us under this distressing circumstance . they provided expert care and glad to say that he mended just fine , with no lasting ill effects .

1,"i ll be back ! laura certainly doesn t need my review for help , but all of these people are correct . she is meticulous , easy to be around and takes joy in her work . when i read all of the star reviews , i sort of thought they might be written by friends because they were so gushy . i found her via yelp . . . . and loved her ! eyebrow wax , takes credit cards .

1,"i m one of those people that loves frozen yogurt . anything that taste this great and is this guilt free will get me every time . the golden spoon has a variety of flavors of fro yo , and each delicious flavor is only calories per ounces . this is good news , my friends . on top of that , the price is very reasonable . i got the mini which is ounces and it rang up to . . when i compare it to desert swirl your other choice of fro yo on the westside , this is extraordinarily more affordable . the service was not overly friendly , but just fine . the ice cream chick was happy to give us some samples . i highly recommend the heath flavored fro yo . delicious .

1,i dropped off a ton of things here when i was liquidating my life in this town and it was a terrific experience . their donation program is quick and easy just drive around to the back of the store and put it in a bin and really helps out people by selling things at affordable prices and the profits go to provide assistance to the community . such great people at this location especially . 
1,"love this little frozen yogurt paradise ! ! i like golden spoon , but this place is definitely a notch above . the toppings bar alone is a reason to check it out . . . . . can you say fruity pebbles anyone ? how awesome is that ? ? ? i like the fact that you choose how much or little you want in whatever combos you crave . the flavors are also really yummy , and they always have a good variety . it s a great place to take kids , as they tend to like anything interactive like this . i m so happy i live close plan on coming lots as the weather heats up .

0,seriously the most pathetic burger i ve had . . . . ever ? on the level of a burger king or the like . with tip i paid for the burger and fries . what a waste and they even managed to get the order wrong . a buffalo burger that had no buffalo sauce on it . when i told the waiter he made up for it by bringing a little cup of sauce . oi . . . pathetic . 
0,this store is a average . it has a six month wall . this place does not bag and board new issues unless asked . the store specializes in new stuff only and has almost no back stock . the store has tournaments for card gaming on weekends . the staff doesn t talk to new customers much or ask them if they need assistance . note for true comic fans . . . this store is good for new comics on wednesdays and supplies but that is about it . dime a dozen store . . . nothing special . 
1,"rarely give a , but truthfully ? we set out to go to giuseppes and stopped here . . . thought we were there . . . i m sure giu . is good , but arrivederci is the bomb . we will keep going on every visit . reasonable and really , really authentic . bueno sera is your welcome . . and they mean it ! we loved it . . . reasonable , too . b"
1,"in a never ending quest to find new lunch spots me and a coworker stumbled upon this place . hearing it from another person we were originally looking for somewhere else . overall i thought the food was excellent . a generous portion , and a price you can t beat . a little difficult to order but got exactly what we wanted . only problem i can see is no where to sit . so you have to take it to go . still worth it .

0,"wowza ! this place is a total trip ! no , i don t smoke , but if i did this place is probably the place i would go to . first off , the food was okay . i ordered some chicken wings , which wasn t really that great . my favorite was the thai curry it definitely had some pop to it . it s one of those that creep up on you . milk please ! my friend ordered some sake that i thought was real good and smooth don t ask me what it was , the lighting was low and i didn t care much by the time i arrived . service was pretty good i guess , and then again the place was drop dead for a friday night . what s up with that ! ? i m sure the place gets hopping on st friday , but that s only one day out of the month i sure it picks up quick ! ambience , was cool , just reminded me of the s in a way even though i didn t grow up during the s haha , but i thought the design and decor were pretty cool . eccentric i think was the word i used . bathroom was blue and that s all i ll say . . . . . . . check it out ! enjoy !

0,"i remember a time when ikea was an almost legendary place where the angels would sing a greeting to me as i passed through the hallowed doors . that was a long time ago . when i was younger and significantly poorer ikea was the one true way i could get semi stylish home furnishings at a reasonable price . many a room was filled with fine pre fab furniture that was always just a wee bit small . it s funny how ones tastes change . this weekend i ventured forth to ikea in search of baby stuff . a good friend of mine is with child and wanted to check out what ikea had to offer . walking through the store i saw the same stuff i saw ten years ago , and while i could still see the appeal , i realized that it just wasn t as cool as i remembered . ah well , at least i still have the memories and the coffee table , end tables , tv stand and lamps . ikea is still great if you have something specifically in mind . my friend found a bunch of excellent decorations for the soon to be born babies room , all for insanely low prices . i bought a few pillows . yes , this is what my life has become . ikea didn t change , i did .

1,very authentic and very good vietnamese food . great value for the money and clearly a favorite with the local vietnamese . the spring rolls were very tasty and came with a terrific peanut sauce . they also provide many other typical condiments on the table to spice up your dish . i had the slice beef pho and it was delicious ! i ll be back . 
1,"i really don t like these types of mexican food places because i feel my mom makes better mexican food . just a note not all filibertos are the same . food taste wise . . . . . this filibertos is bomb though ! they make great spanish rice , and beans ! all the food is great ! but i recommend the rolled tacos if it s going to be your first time here . i think it s combo haha . they also have some old school arcade games . that s a plus for me haha . please stop going to macayos they have the worst fake tasting mexican food .

1,"i ve only hiked camelback once , but i felt so accomplished albeit winded , and mere minutes away from passing out . we started the hike at in the morning , and got to watch the sunrise while we made our way up the trail . i thought it wasn t going to be a bad hike , but things get tougher about two thirds up . things starting getting vertical at some points , and i wasn t really prepared for that . it was totally worth it once we got to the top , though gorgeous , view of the phoenix metro area and really , much more than that . and watching the sunrise with someone special is pretty awesome too .

0,"we stayed for three nights while visiting family for the holidays . good very comfortable bed clean funky cool decor which is unique very friendly and helpful staff fair price great location not so good pricey overnight parking that was a surprise upon check in no coffee maker in room this is pretty well standard for most hotels . we had to either go to the lobby for . per cup or drive off site . on our final morning before leaving hours before checkout with our do not disturb sign duly mounted on the outside of our door , we were disturbed by a rap rap rap rap of who i assume was the cleaner . wtf !

1,"just fantastic . i first went to cornish pasty in a few months after they opened and fell in love immediately . although a few things have changed over the years each one is usually an improvement and never a negative . if you are not familiar , a pasty is a traditional british coal miners food . a hearty filling wrapped in a pie crust and baked . kind of a hand held meat pie . cornish pasty co . has taken this simple and traditional dish and meticulously perfected each component . their crusts are some how simultaneously hearty and flaky . although their is nothing delicate about their seasoning it is never out of balance and all of the ingredients are always quality . beyond just mastering the finer details of pasty science , cornish pasty co . has also branched off into wild and exotic flavors . it s no shocker that the british know indian food and it shows with the tika masala and the lamb vindaloo pasties . what is shocking is the refinement of the greek and italian inspired pasties . perhaps my favorite pasty , from the cuisine most elusive to the british , is the carne avadado . this is a mexican inspired pasty that will satisfy even the most snobby las cruses el paso foodie . if you have ever talked mexican food with one you will know just what i mean . i have eaten nearly every item on the menu and not a one disappoints . it took me ages to get past the pasties and start ordering soups and salads . now that i have had the spinach , mushroom , walnut soup , it is hart to save room for my old favorites . although the mine shaft inspired interior is dark and cramped i have never felt uncomfortable there . the sound system is usually bumping classic rock and the employees are pierced and tattooed well beyond your typical wait staff , but everyone is friendly and service is typically good . if i have to list a negative the only one i can think of is the food is consistently just a little better at the university location than the dobson one . no clue why , but everyone i ve talk to seems to agree , the tempe store has the edge on quality . after you add a respectable selection of beers the only reason you won t be here every night is your waist line .

1,this is my neighborhood grocery store . it s at the two locations i shop at most . it s always clean and well stocked and i never have to wait in line for very long . 
0,"i like the bamboo club , but it doesn t seem to bode well with purists . it is a very americanized spin on chinese food , with some dishes it works well and others not so much . i struggle with a fierce addiction to panda express so i refer to it from time to time , but i feel i m justified this time . bamboo club is like a deluxe version of panda express . in fact , their best dish is also the orange chicken , only done much more tastefully than their greasy counterparts . it s a little overpriced considering what they are offering semi glorified mall food but , all in all , not bad . "
0,the location has closed again . not good if you have prepaid washes or other credits as the business has closed . some speculation on other sites is that they have filed for bankruptcy again . don t bother stopping by to use their services as the facility is cordoned off and a big sign says business closed . 
0,"eh no . i stopped here for quick take out one day while at work . they had no sushi at all even though it s on the menu , and the menu itself isn t laid out very well for understanding what they have what s included . i wasn t there to eat onsite , but good thing very little inside seating . the food wasn t all that good , and if the customer says to go , then you should put utensils and napkins in the bag for me . the place didn t seem very clean either . just not a good experience . go somewhere else . "
1,"a little pricey for my liking , but good nonetheless . i really like the feel of the restaurant part cuban , part puerto rican , part spanish , all classy . a guitar player jammed away in a completely non annoying way while we ate our meal and , to me , that is an accomplishment . our calypso chips were outstanding . to die for . one of the best appetizers i can think of at the moment . for my entree , i ordered the ropa vieja which was made up of the most perfectly tender beef and tasty rice with beans . a little heavy with the peppers , however . does anybody else think plantains smell like feet ? my date pointed this out and , although i was surprised , i m inclined to agree . that won t stop me from putting some into my stomach as soon as humanly possible .

1,"try the chicken parmesan ! it s the best i ve ever had ? quite possibly . when i worked in that area we would hit it for lunch once a week . donna is awesome in a take no shit but still take care of you kind of way . she calls it as she sees it and i think that s great . by your third visit she will most likely know what you are gunna order . i can t comment on the rest of the menu as i ve only ordered the chicken parm . yeah , it s that good .

1,"these guys are great ! i even though they specialize in mercedes , they never have a problem with my bmw x . the owner , charles , knows what he is doing and never tries to up sell you on unnecessary work . mary charles wife is a really sweet lady who always gives me a ride home and picks me up when the car is ready . while aurohaus doesn t have loaner cars like the dealership , they are extremely competent , trustworthy , and charge reasonable prices for their services .

0,"this place is the white trash chipotle . the food is mediocre at best . i mean seriously , how can you just up and steal chipotle s idea ! there s no creativity there . the habenaro salsa is flavorless and not hot at all . seriously ? i asked for hot , not some yellowish tomato concoction for the people who can t handle real salsa ! at least chipotle has hot salsa not too hot either but much better for a fast americanized mexican food . of course i much rather have the real deal but i do like chiptole for what it is . not this crap that qdoba tries to serve up . the chicken is over seasoned and highly spiced herbed you can barely taste the chicken . the fajita veggie were the same . the product looked of very low quality . oxidizing guacamole and lettuce . the meat looked unappetizing as well . just not at the level of chipotle . although i have been here twice , this is the last time for me . i have been to one in denver and for some reason thought it was better . so maybe it s management but i can say the food is less than good . i much rather go to chiptole than this wannabe ! employees were dumber than a bag of frijoles ! this place has the worst mexican food i have ever had next to a pre made burrito from or a burrito from taco bell . just disgusting food .

1,"this is the only work of his that i have seen in person . after living in the valley since , i finally decided to head out that way . i found the information about the life and times of frank lloyd and his rd wife very interesting . the house was amazing and beautiful . i especially loved the local rocks cast into the concrete , and the lines that created a flow . i would highly recommend this tour to any one with an interest in form , function , and beauty .

1,be sure to save up for the coffee machine they demo d for me ! nuts ! i could never imagine paying as much for a coffee machine as i would for a used car ! i am really wanting to take one of the cooking classes they offer here . soon maybe . . . hoping for a sur le table groupon ! 
0,"it s an upscale casual restaurant with nice decor star , a quick meal before or after shopping . a quick meal means only if you get good sever plus quick service . we went to have brunch on sunday and it was pretty packed in there . after looked at their simple brunch menu , we decided to get grilled hanger steak with scrambled eggs , and cinnamon french toast with fruit compote syrup . . it wasn t too impressive , the food was just ok star . i think you pay more for the ambiance than the dishes . the service was alright star . it felt like you are in the market with chit chat and bargain noise , which i thought it was kinda annoying . "
0,"this place gets an a for effort , but i think it falls slightly short . it s neat cute that the wasabi is actually blue , and some of their rolls like the pink dyed rice for the marilyn monroe roll are innovative , but the food is only a little above average . i liked the rolls okay , but the best thing i put in my mouth was the shrimp tempura appetizer in the martini glass . that appetizer is to die for ! the miso soup was pretty good , but not my favorite . we did like the fact that there were only a few tables and it wasn t a huge place with a million people , but the food just wasn t what we expect . we are going to continue hunting for our favorite sushi restaurant in scottsdale . . . . . the service here was very good , though , which made the experience pretty pleasant overall .

1,"for the past ten years ever since funsports occupied the same unit , this place has been the one stop shop for my biking needs . from bmx at age to road cycling in adulthood , smc usually has what i m looking for . the prices don t really compete with larger chains like performance , but they are reasonable and the service more than makes up for the difference . when i was getting into road cycling , the guys at the shop were very helpful with selection , fit , and pricing . a !

1,"i have to admit , i normally don t like chinese food . in fact , it s just about the only style of food i haven t fallen in love with at some point in my life . this is a real problem when you live with someone that would die for chinese food at all hours of the day night . i figured out why i never liked chinese food when i first ate at asian cafe express . it s because everything i ve had has been americanized chinese food ! ! ! it was like an epiphany and seriously music to my tastebuds when i actually found chinese food i not only liked , i loved ! having authentic chinese food changed my opinion completely about this cuisine . i have to agree with the others . . . save yourself the time and skip the first few pages . go straight to the back of the menu to find authentic hong kong style fare . holy mother of god , everything i ve tried has been outstanding and each time i leave saying it was the best meal i ve tried thus far . everything is extremely cheap and the service is superb . the wait staff are always very helpful and knowledgeable about their food . they ll be quick to recommend something if you re having a hard time deciding . just ask !

1,"clean , comfortable , smoke free , fast service , nice staff . also , their complimentary breakfast had a nice variety of food items . there is juice and coffee bagels , yogurts , waffles and cereals . the hotel was a lot nicer than i expected , and i would definitely stay here again . "
0," stars only because the house margarita and guacamole was so good . the food was decent fish tacos , however the patio atmosphere was a bit sad . i understand this is more of a bar than a fine dining restaurant but the patio tables had no place settings , condiments , etc . . . just cheap metal tables and chairs . also there was no music out there , just this incessant humming of a back alley generator . the service was a bit sporadic out on the patio as well . we were asked by three different servers if we have a server yet . not much in the way of organization . maybe management just hasn t gotten around to fully organizing and furnishing the patio yet . i hope they do , because they are in a great location and the food and drinks give them lots of potential . "
1,"the workers here are helpful and nice . especially the chubby mexican man ! he was awesome and popped up in the veggie aisle and then bagged our groceries too . somehow we also got a discount on our groceries we didn t have a discount card or anything since we are out of towners . even though this place smells like most chinese supermarkets , i would definitely come back if i needed something .

0,"priced decent , quantity heavy . just ordered a side of chips and got almost a pound of chips . i love chips and salsa , but this was too much than i thought . anyway the food was good and seems to have a authentic mexican flavor to it . worth a short once , particularly if you are pretty hungry .

0,"well , it dropped a star for me , and i ll tell you why . eaten there probably time in the last quarter . i ve had it all all you can eat sushi , bowls , desert , beer . ate alone , ate with sandra k , ate with son and family including year old grandson who plays drums with the chopsticks had a party of there . service . . . . slow on saturday for the ayes , otherwise i can t complain . there are some bright spots . first , it s close to my neighborhood , a start and there is more than sushi and that is helpful when you have non sushi lovers with you . the bowls are very good and you can order them in the heat index you like . funny names to them as well , like the exit wound bowl or the classified bowl with this description don t order this bowl . squid salad is great , great , great ! calamari , ok . hey they put a lot of thought into their beer selection and that is cool . and their dessert sushis are very unique . as for the sushi . . . . i now have way too many sushi restaurants to try and they are all falling over themselves for your business . sushi has become really hip lately but there will be a fall out in this category as the economy continues to slow and people , let s face it , are pulling back . this is not a place for a sushi purist , but give me good food , a cool gathering place close to my central phoenix abode and i will be there . sushi has got to get better for me to rate higher and earn my business .

1,"the roaring fork is one of my very favorite restaurants . i am not a big fan of the environment , particularly the patio and back rooms , but the food more than makes up for it . the pork green chili served with warm tortillas is dreamy . i also adore the huckleberry margaritas . can t go wrong . "
0,this baja fresh really didn t impress me . it s pricey considering that all you re getting is meat in a tortilla . it doesn t have that mexican feel to it and is unoriginal . there were bugs on the wall . the food is good however . nothing special though . since it s a corporate chain you can t expect sizzling flavor but i was left unsatisfied . there are better mexican food places to go to . 
1,this is my favorite of the yard house restaurants and not just because it is on my side of town . the food always seems to be done just right and my husband and his sister enjoy the beer . would have given one more star but my husband has yet to find any food item that makes him want to go here over some other restaurant . since i just can t seem to get enough of the grilled cheese and tomato bisque soup it is very disappointing that he doesn t want to go . 
0,"its refreshing to find one of a kind places god knows phoenix needs more of them to inject personality into this generic , strip mall , chains on every corner valley . finding this unique sandwich shop , which is in a house that has been transformed into a restaurant , is indeed a welcome find . the real estate is limited , so parking is compact and circles around the back of the building . the dining area is mainly indoors , but there is also a small patio facing the back portion of the parking lot , which is not very scenic . inside there is art on the wall that can be purchased . they serve wraps , bowls and salads . the food has been pretty good , although it did not knock my socks off . i ordered the baja bowl , which is described on their online menu as southwestern chicken atop garlic rice , black beans , monterey jack cheese and topped with lime sour cream and pico de gallo . it was ok , but the chicken was dry and cut in fairly large chunks . it could have possibly been microwaved not sure , but there were no southwest flavors to speak of . i have done a better job of cooking chicken on my george foreman grill at home . perhaps the garlic rice would have helped with the flavor , but i had substituted the rice with organic brown rice which did little to add flavor . sour cream was not lime . there was a small slice of lime served on the edge of the bowl . i would not bother ordering this again especially if i have a craving for some southwest food . on another recent visit i ordered a wrap called prince of thai s spicy peanut chicken with baby spinach , garlic rice , fresh ginger slaw , cucumber pico and red onion wrapped in a spinach tortilla . that had better flavor than the baja bowl . vegetable ingredients were fresh and good . again , i was not very impressed with the chicken chunks . one thing i think that s a wrap needs to address is the use of styrafoam cups . afterall their slogan is healthy food for a hungry planet and they have a link for a new restaurant green for vegan food on their website . for such an artsy , earthy place , i would have thought that s a wrap would have made more conscious , earth friendly choices . for that reason and the bland chicken , i give them an average rating only .

1,"i visited this place in january while i was in phoenix and i miss the food ! my vegan friend suggested this place to me and my other friend we were skeptical that vegan food could taste good . . . she proved us wrong ! the food here was delicious , i d eat here regularly if i lived in phoenix ! when we arrived , we were worried about the hours since we got there pretty close to closing time , but they were cool ! we shared the samosas and buffalo wings for appetizers . i ordered the thai peanut bowl with mock chicken and noodles for my entree . i felt like everything was flavored well and while i enjoy meat normally , this opened my mind to trying other vegetarian places in the future . i liked the ambiance here , great place to grab a bite with friends and chill . it was the perfect place to stop by after a busy weekend ! i ll be back next time i m in the area .

1,"great service , atmosphere and of course great food . my wife and i decided on blue last night for dinner . we have been there many times , but we felt we needed to share our experience . we enjoyed sitting at the bar having a few drinks and visiting other patrons . around we realized the kitchen would be closing . i asked daniel and baeley the bartenders what time the kitchen served dinners of course he stated pm oops . but daniel said they would prepare what ever we wanted . i asked him to check to see if they have already started to clean up first . we do not like to ask the kitchen staff to prepare dinner if they had already began or completed clean up . daniel returned to say that yes they had finished the grill , but he again repeated that they would still prepare anything we wanted . at that time we declined to have the kitchen staff prepare anything . but a moment later , roman the chef came up to us and sincerely stated that he would be more than pleased to prepare whatever we wanted . still we were not wanting to make such a request that late , but with his sincere and friendly personality he still insisted that they were more than willing . so we asked him to pick and prepare something of his choice which turned out to be the best two burgers that we have enjoyed in a long time , a bacon cheese burger and his speciality texan jalapeno burger both with extra crispy bacon just the way we like it . sooooo . . . . we would highly recommend blue and it s staff including by name , roman the chef and daniel and baeley the bartenders . every time we have gone to blue we have had nothing but a great experience , this place is a must ! ! !

1,"i really like this place . there aren t that many lanes , so if you plan to go on a friday or saturday night , call ahead and reserve your lane . this place has a lounge area with a good sized bar and couch area . over where the lanes are , there are about pool tables , another bar , and another table and couches area . the end of the lanes have screens above them to watch sports or music videos . they play good music very loud . i had a really great time . my only complaint , we reserved lanes for hours , and when the hours was up , they wanted us out immediately . they started bussing the tables just taking drinks away . i was busy changing my shoes and didn t notice the busboy grabbed my drink . excuse me , i just purchased that . i let him know that i understood they wanted us gone , but should ask the person sitting there which drink is theirs before throwing it away . as we were leaving , i was at the other table in our area and the busboy asks me if any of the drinks on that table were mine . i reminded him that he threw mine away and he should probably be asking that question to somebody else . it really annoyed me . i would definitely recommend it for a sunday fun day . i didn t feel like we could really relax and have a good time on a saturday because it was too busy and the staff was looking to make money rather than have their guests entertained .

1,this salon is really cute . fridays are off single sessions and this is why i keep coming back . i use the level bed and on fridays its only to tan . i wouldn t come here if they didn t have that though because membership prices are ridiculous and the customer service isn t that great .

1,its not a standard restaurant as it is in the middle of a grocery store . . . but thats just what it is get over it ! the food however is fantastic ! i ordered the samosa chaat . . . a samosa covered in chick peas and other sauces and chatney . a delicious punjabi snack ! the portion was very generous and the price cheap . i also recently ordered a dozen samosas to bring home and serve at a dinner party . very convenient and good service . i will be a regular from now on !

1,"originally came by to get a watering system for our chickens and ended up buying something for every member of our furry family ! they have everything here for cats , dogs , small birds , rabbits , poultry , horses and more ! the customer service was excellent , we were even given free samples for our chickens without even asking and were given informational sheets about some awesome products we ended up buying as well . both of the people working were concerned with taking their time to help us , not about making a sale , and will even special order some products for us if ever needed . we don t feed our dogs dry food anymore they now eat raw instead , but when we did , these are the premium healthiest brands we were buying at a much higher cost at other retailers . the prices are low , the hours are convenient , the customer service was great , the products are healthy , and the selection was large for how small the shop is , what more could you ask for ? great first visit and we will definitely be coming back again !

1,"i ll keep this sweet and to the point , realistically , i d give this place a . pros willing to accommodate food allergens i ve vegan , and super lactose intolerant . beautifully decorated restaurant , well plated food . the food is made to order , even the sauces . i liked some of the inventive touches in their food my curry with peas , pumpkin , baby corn . one of our companions asked for extra sauce and they very kindly made more cons portions are ridiculously small for the price . everyone at our table of ordered a separate entree , and no own was full , even the ones who got appetizers . my throat was killing me , so i asked for some warm water , instead of iced , while i looked over the menu they brought back water that was colder than room temp , without the ice and i was politely informed that this is what they had . but i wonder how in the world they serve hot tea on the menu , if they don t have hot water in the kitchen . some of the veggies in my curry were undercooked think aldente potato all in all the flavor of the food was good , but cup of rice and . cups of curry does not a dollar entree make . you really are paying for the ambience and customer service . if i had a special occasion , i d prolly visit here again , but when i m needing a thai fix , there are other places around town that have equally great food , without the upcharge .

1,"ate there for the first time last night and the food was fantastic . they did a great job on the remodel , so it s a lot more open than it was before . they have an extensive wine list and the service was wonderful . we will definitely go back ! "
1,"love this spot it s pretty close to the convention center so natalie and i went here to check it out . the bacon is awesome here ! their philosophy is great too local , organic , etc . etc . the place is tiny and quaint too and as always it s great to support a local independent business . best breakfast in phoenix that i ve had and definitely one of my fave spots went there the next day too got the special and it was delish check my photos to see what we got !

1,"so much food for so little money , and they have kids meals that the kids will actually eat . if you do not like what they offer in the cafeteria you can get food downstairs like pizza and hotdogs . . . what kid does not like pizza or a hotdog ? i had the meatballs and mashed potatoes and they were so good . i wish there was something bad to say about eating in a furniture store cafeteria , but there really is not it was great food , great service and fun for the kids there is a play area with a tv that they can eat at too so the parents can enjoy their food too my wife had the herb chicken and it looked great too , and she said it was really tasty too . she loved it . the desserts were amazing too , and very filling so much food for so little the money ! i wish it was not so far away from queen creek , or i would hit it up so much more often !

1,"the place did not disappoint . the moment we stepped through the archway , my friends and i were bedazzled by the ambience throughout the area . it really does feel like a tavern , almost like something out of pirates of the caribbean well . . kind of but yeah , the portions were overwhelming , and best of all ? the food was spectacular . i sat outside , but honestly ? i think the place is pretty both ways , so don t be too stingy on the location jus go .

1,"the best part about logan s is the rolls and i don t mind that you do not need to add butter because it is already dripping with butter . yum ! i can taste a hint of beer in the roll as well . . . or it could just be yeast . . or wishful thinking . i am trying to be healthier , so i went with the salad and water . the anything and everything salad does have some good items included craisins , pecans , egg , grilled chicken and a good balsamic vinaigrette dressing . . . but still it was a salad . maybe i should have ordered the grilled streak salad . . . but the peanuts are a free appetizer and you can throw them on the floor . what fun ! the sweet tea is outstanding and reminds me of my days in atlanta . another review commented about the similarity between logan s and texas roadhouse . they are very similar , but i wouldn t say logan s is a knock off . plus logan s was started in to texas roadhouse s , so perhaps they are the ones being imitated ? come in for a sweet tea , free peanuts and the excellent rolls . the rest is about your average steakhouse . two salads , one tea and a water .

0,"an upscale mexican restaurant in the area seemed like the best thing to have happened to me . i planned my visit for a quieter evening , and reviewed the menu again and again . however , upon our arrival i thought twice immediately . the parking was iffy , and the place didn t seem to stand up to the signage . perhaps the art was not to my liking , honestly not a piece stands out in my memory . we were seated immediately . our waiter seemed a little off , not to mention the fact that he was insanely snobby and seemed to be moonlighting in the kitchen , where he disappeared for minutes at a time . he did not fill our soft drinks once without being first flagged down those of you who have experienced the close quarters will understand how ridiculous this is . halfway through waiting for our food which took minutes , easily , the lamp above our table went out . we sat in the dark for a good minutes before they even noticed . which was actually a nice change of scenery from the boring beige walls . when the food finally arrived , we were too tired due to having finished an entire bottle of wine so we left . unfortunately , we took our grub with us . i had some sort of mixed seafood entree with chorizo and a creamy sauce . it s no coincidence you re taken aback by the combination . . . it didn t go down too easily . having dropped dollars on the meal , though , we felt compelled to finish as much as we could stand . normally i would make sure i got the name of the dish right , but since i am recommending that you not go there , why bother ?

0,"very mixed feelings about this hotel . location is very close to asu s tempe campus , so it s convenient if you re visiting asu . the surrounding city of the hotel is fillllled with methamphetamine addicts . and yes , it is very creepy and that is coming from a year old male . the customer service inside the hotel was great . the breakfast buffet also tasted good . the hotel rooms are nice , although they only have water available which is annoying and the fridge is locked so you can t store any of your drinks . the reason why i docked stars was not so much the tweakers , as it was the loud clunk sound whenever the ac turns off . from what i ve heard , this happens in every room . so , if you need to sleep with ac at night and you will , in the summer be sure to buy or bring ear plugs . it s the only way to get through the night trust me . . . .

1,"roka akor has a classy atmosphere , and a slightly formidable menu to pick from . everything looks so good , and in a new environment , i want to try it all ! but my date and i , after much deliberation , decided to go for broke , as it were and if we couldn t finish , at least we had a good sample of the menu . for an appetizer , we got the butterfish tataki and the burnt red tomato salad . these were yummy little tidbits that disappeared off the plate quickly . the butterfish was delicate , and the salad was great the greens had all sorts of different flavors , and not that generic clump of lettuce flavor i hate . from the sushi menu , i was feeling adventurous and had never had raw red meat before , so i ordered the wagyu gunkan . my date saw the amount of green onions piled on top of this dish and oh so chivalrously gave me his piece . it s true that you needed a healthy appreciation of green onion to like these as served . the wagyu beef is ground nearly to a puree which i wasn t expecting , and i thought the onion was a bit much . at for the skewers we ordered , my date liked his sweet potatoes the best , but i was partial to the crispy bbq . these turned out to be two large ovoid and solid shapes of rice , run through with a skewer . pure white sushi rice in the center , the outside was caramelized with what tasted like the sweet bbq sauce that comes on eel sushi , which gave the whole thing a nice , crispy shell . at this point , i got to what i consider to be the crowning achievement of the meal the yuzu marinated black cod . the cod , cooked on the robata grill in a leaf , was meltingly soft and delicately flavored . it was an effort to be share fairly . i believe my date said after our first taste of it , just eat what you want and i ll finish . . . , i looked up from my chopsticks , . . . you know what ? just cut me off half . i wasn t sure that i could handle dessert after eating so much , but we finally decided it wouldn t be fair not to give the dessert menu a looking over , right ? so we ordered the baked green tea custard , and it was a perfect pick after a gut busting meal . light and airy , it also had some carbonation to it that tickled my taste buds and made me giggle a lot as i was eating it . our sampler of shochu ranged from impressive to harsh , at least to my taste buds . in order starting with least harsh pineapple , honeycomb , raspberry , and apple . i didn t like the last two , but the pineapple was , in my mind , a fairly dangerous thing to drink when you re not paying attention . smooth . that s it for the food , and as for the service , it was swift and considerate glasses were kept full , and empty plates whisked away . there was , however , one glaring exception that nearly overpowered the entire evening with its oddness . the waiter , who had up till this point been very nice and chatty , helpful about menu items , and generally a pretty cool guy , handed me his phone number and told us to call him any time we wanted to go partying . what am i supposed to do with this ? are we going to call our waiter up and say . . . well , what ? it flummoxed me .

0,"had breakfast at joe s diner this morning . i had the number , and a side of potatoes . it was supposed to come with bacon and sausage , but for some reason , mine came with four pieces of bacon . i didn t question it because the waitress seemed a little absent minded and we had to ask for a side that she had already forgotten . the few times she came to check on us , she would ask if everything was ok and would walk away so fast that we couldn t tell her what we needed . the positive here is that the pancakes were really tasty . i would have given joe s stars if the service was better , but i think there could be some improvement there .

1,"union is a nice cozy place set on the fringe of old town scottsdale . the inside has a nice homey feel with booths that have extra throw pillows love that and soft lighting and desert scape paintings . a big drawback is that while half of the seats face the lovely paintings the other half face the kitchen . the wine flights are good but the pours are inconsistent and not as hearty as in some places . the bulk of their wine menu comes in bottle form . they do offer oz pours of wine for about a glass . be careful when you order , as we were given oz pours and had no idea we were getting them . the food was quite good , they actually had real grilled focaccia and this garlic cream butter that was delicious . its tapas style and we ordered three and it was more than enough for the two of us . all of the tapas we ordered were well prepared . we also ordered dessert which was very mediocre . i would come back again but probably for a happy hour . as far as food goes it wasn t my favorite at a wine bar . they do have a patio out front that looks like it would be very cozy on a cool evening .

1,"came here for dinner and dim sum . dinner probably deserves stars but dim sum was probably stars , so i ll just average my experience to stars . food dinner there s these dishes that are on sale right now for less than and most of them are clay pot dishes which are delicious ! . all the dinner items we ordered were amazing ! especially the green beans ! those were flavored and stir fried to perfection ! i ve had this dish many times at many different places and this was by far the best green bean dish i ve ever had ! the clay pots were all amazing ! everything tasted sooo good ! dim sum not enough dim sum items and the ones that did show up were only ok . we were sitting around for a really long time and nothing would come . when the ladies did come by with the carts , they would not even try to sell us anything . we had to be all proactive and ask everyone what s in the carts . even when we did that , the ladies would just say nothing new and push the cart away . we had to order things from the kitchen but even those things would take forever to come . a few of the dim sum dishes we ordered came after we asked for our check and paid already . service dinner great service ! no complaints there ! dim sum really slow . . . why was there no food ? ? ? ambiance this restaurant is in the middle of a food court of a shopping plaza . they just put up dividers to section off the restaurant from the rest of the food court . i was hesitant to eat at this place , but i m glad i did because dinner was amazing ! dim sum . . . that s a different story . if you get over the fact that you are really sitting in the middle of a food court , then it s not so bad . price both dinner and dim sum items were pretty cheap . overall i really liked eating dinner here ! all the dishes were delicious ! dim sum probably would have been better if there was more food and the dim sum ladies were better about showing us what was available . i would totally come again for dinner but maybe not dim sum .

0,"ppp was decent . the white chocolate beer was delicious . i will be back for some more of that . i cannot wait to go back for happy hour . steak is steak to me . it was not out of this world , but it was good . the sides were fair , beans and bread . the beans lacked flavor , but i might just be biased , my dad makes a mean pot of cowboy beans . the whole restaurant is very kitschy . everything revolves around the cowboy theme . this place would be great to take tourists . for undercooked steak for tasteless beans"
0,"what happened to this place ? the first time i went about a year ago , both the food and service were great . second time , last may , i ordered the same dish and it was horrible . drowning in sauce . but , at least the service was decent . just went a third time and it will be my last . both the food and service were horrible . went for lunch , sat inside and it wasn t very busy . our waiter was totally out of it and only had tables and hardly paid any attention to us and kept forgetting things , like taking our order to start . then , even the food runner forgot to bring me half my meal after i asked her for it . in the meantime , i counted at least staff member hanging out in the kitchen area , which is open , so you can see them and half of them were folding napkins . my food was not very good and actually made me a little sick . this is a shame , especially because there aren t many places in phx that have vegan choices , but for the price you pay , i would expect a lot more .

1,"one of my favorite aspects of this central phoenix wine bar is that it is still somewhat undiscovered , aka not teeming with hipsters and young professionals on a thursday evening after work . it stays busy , but not jam packed . their happy hour is great , nice small plate options , and you must try their cherry lemon drop martini . seriously delicious . get a ride from someone , because you ll probably want another the decor is cool and they play french movies on a large screen in the back of the restaurant . i also have a special place in my heart for their awesome sweet potato fries ! this place is a great option if you want a nice glass of wine and a bite to eat in central phoenix but don t want to brave the postino crowds .

1,i tried this place on a recommendation of a friend . their frozen yogurt is really good . the peanut butter flavor was rich and creamy . they also had a wide array of toppings . the only downfall is they were a bit pricey . i had the small cup whcich was not even full but once it was weighed cost almost dollars . i would still say very yummy and worth trying . 
0,"i have been to this place twice and i have had both extremes . the good shannon , california sea bass , michelle manager s customer service the bad fried calamari , our last waiter s breath the first visit to this establishment was our encounter with shannon . shannon was a pure delight as our waitress . she made our first visit absolutely fun . my wife had a tilapia dish that she was less than enamored with but i had the california sea bass and that tasted very good . in fact , it was so good that i regretted not getting a glass of chardonnay to go with it . the fish had a very nice texture and taste . our second visit was our first encounter with the fried calamari . as our guest so eloquently said , if this was my first impression of fried calamari , i would not have liked it . the calamari was overcooked and there was so much oil running on the plate . we called this issue to michelle s attention and she agreed that the dish was not prepared properly . she gave us a coupon to come back there and eat at any time . however , our waiter s breath was another story . whenever he spoke , i could smell his pungent trust me , a lot better than what i really wanted to say breath to the point i almost donned a gas mask . there are very few things that would cause me to lose my appetite . his malodorous breath and the calamari with more grease than a jiffy lube accomplished the feat .

1,"i searched hi and lo and had only been able to make good on the very lo with regards to good chinese food in the valley . i am very picky and i rate most chinese food places based on the thickness of the membrane of their won ton soup and the colour of their fried rice . having passed my non doughy and not yellow test yup people , some places give you frozen dumplings versus fresh and yellow spanish rice in a chinese restaurant , i was able to look into the quality of their other food items . when you can deliver mei fun singapore style noodles perfectly seasoned with no greasy residue , i feel you deserve that illusive fifth star . service was pleasant and there was a lot of foot traffic for take away items . i also note that they offered iced thai tea with cream . my buddy got a plate of broccoli , tofu , and a wonderful kun pao sauce . sorry , but i think he created it himself and they make everything to order just for food snobs such as we . hmmmm . i am getting hungry . i think i will go there now . wonder if i should get their pepper steak .

0,"over the last years or so , i ve eaten lunch at dilly s deli a couple dozen times . the location is excellent , as it is near my office , and the interior d cor is clean , modest , and charming . the music seems to vary , but on today s trip , it appeared to be a mix of oldies and jazzy easy listening . while i ve never had to wait for a table to clear , seating can be limited during lunch hours . the service is friendly and quick and the menu offerings plentiful and interesting . vegetarians will find a handful of options here , though it is likely you can request to omit meat from any sandwich or salad . carrying boar s head ingredients is a plus , however the way their sandwiches are assembled and the ratio of ingredients used simply doesn t work for me . oftentimes , i find my sandwich has a bulge of deli meat in the center and much less and sometimes none at all toward the outer parts nearing the crust . it has been my experience that the wraps are not treated this way , though the only wrap i ve tried mexi lacked flavor and tasted processed . i ve eaten one salad at dilly s the greek and , while it is tasty , i discovered a dead fly in it halfway through and haven t ordered a salad there since . as other reviewers have reported , the soups aren t as piping hot as i d like , though the variety and additional daily soup is appreciated . the bread is deliciously soft , warm , flavorful , and large ideal for accompanying a soup or salad . if you re accustomed to filling up on a sandwich made with normal sized slices , i suggest ordering a half sandwich so you can sample a side of soup , salad , or dessert as well . all sandwiches are served with a pickle spear . the cookies and brownies get stars on their own . today i gave dilly s another shot and ordered a new menu item , the red bird , on wheat . personally , i m not a fan . the blazin buffalo , dilly bird , and smokey mountain boast far better flavor combinations , imo . also , my pickle spear had a hair on it . dilly s is a bit pricier than its nearby competition all whole sandwiches are . , though a reasonable price if shared . overall , this is a higher quality sandwich shop than subway , blimpie , and the like . unfortunately , the fly and hair experiences combined with the bread meat ratio issue guarantee i will not return .

1,"honestly the best part of this place is the unbelievable deal you can get on pet related products . because they are one of the primary income sources for halo animal rescue , people that have pets , tend to make donations . you can almost always find pet carriers for under . they have dog crates for training and you don t have to shell out a fortune for them . they have fish tanks that will allow you to let little johnny get his feet wet in the world of pet care and the associated responsibilities without breaking the bank . if you are a person that shares your life with animals , you understand the rarity of these kinds of deals ! yes they have clothes , furniture , tchatchkies , etc . , but the real deals are on the pet products . as a side note , halo recently leased the mccac location at north th avenue it was the previous maricopa county run cat adoption center . so if you are looking for a companion cat or dog , check them out and support one of the fastest growing no kill efforts in the us . http www . halorescue . org index . html"

0,"calling all vegans , gluten free s , vegetarians and those who enjoy eating healthy . nourish is probably your garden of eden . hidden within the optima , nourish is a health food fan s paradise . the environment is fresh and clean and so is the food . upon walking inside , i noticed how calm and refreshing the restaurant was . everyone had the same calm attitude and i could tell that this is a restaurant you visit to relax and still feel healthy when you leave . the menu is detailed but not overwhelming . the only overwhelming part was trying to decipher what each icon indicated and soon i learned that most of the food is gluten free , vegan , vegetarian or some other food lifestyle other than carnivore . but , for those not following an alternative food lifestyle , it s still incredibly tasty and makes me rethink my cuisine decisions ! nourish serves breakfast all day bonus as well as lunch . it s a great brunch spot . the eggs benedict is spot on . i can t tell what sort of herb or tweak they add to the hollaindase sauce but it doesn t taste like your typical eggs benedict . their breakfast sandwich is tasty as well but a little bit more on the dry and healthy side . their ingredients are fresh as is their produce . if they push the cinnamon roll on you it s because it s like a cinnamon god s protege and worth every calorie consumed . plus it s flowing with frosting . nourish has a great patio for dining as well as spacious seating inside , but the patio is covered enough that even on a hot day it s comfortable to sit outside . so in summary , nourish is a good choice if you re looking for a healthy meal that will fill you up . i will absolutely be back and i can t wait to try some of the lunch items that looks tasty . note be sure to check the times before visiting nourish . i was surprised to find out that they open at on saturdays but on sundays .

1,"i came here for the first time ever on mother s day . they were packed , the line was out the door and down the path . still they managed to get everyone seated and quickly attended to . we were a party of our server was so great and i am sorry to say i do not remember her name . she had all drinks refilled continuously . brought us lemons and cleared the table with amazing speed , as well as taking care of a completely full restaurant packed with children that were running under foot . the only down part was that they had plastic dishes but , with all those people what are your choices . i loved the food . i had shrimp and fish and vegetables . nothing fried . the best part for me was the chocolate fondu ! ! although there were many different choices . you could never say that you did not like what they were serving . have seen a million adverts for this place and i am happy that i finally got to go .

0,"this really amounts to . stars . i think after seeing all of the stellar reviews combined with my love for filipino food , my expectations were just too high . i took a few coworkers with me to check out the food and see if i had finally found a local filipino eatery to curb my cravings . not so much . the pancit my favorite filipino entree seemed to lack flavor and or seasoning . i also wanted more meat and veggies maybe that s just due to what i m used to . it was more just oily noodles and missed that flavor i wanted . the good news is the pancit is cooked to order so it s very fresh and hot just be prepared to wait a few minutes . i was also very excited to get some lumpia . again , not so much . they were tiny with some mushed ingredients in them . also again , it may be just what i am used to , but i ve always had ones which are longer with more fillings stuff you can actually see and taste what s in them . on a positive note , the folks there are extremely friendly and helpful . it makes me want to like it even more . i ll go back and give it another go i ll give the chicken adobo my other favorite a shot for some redemption . a few tips if you order pancit , order first because everyone s items are not brought out at once and the rest of your party will be waiting on you . it is a small place tough to fit the of us . there were only a few other tables to seat . i really wanted to like you karey s kitchen . . .

1,this place is classic goodness ! everything tastes rich and fresh ! has a new modern feel with a twist of luxury and artistic flare . the food presentation is gorgeous and the food tastes even better then it looks ! in a wonderful area of town and is built in the old post office . an inventive and one of a kind idea has really set apart this delicious place from any other restaurant in the valley !

1,"ok so us hot chix got all dolled up for dinner at city hall it was about when we arrived on saturday . the service was top notch from the get go starting with the valet . we were seated by a pleasant hostess in the large main room . our waiter was an entertaining gentleman , that s one huge plus i have to say about mastro s is they usually have seasoned wait staff they really know their product . they brought us the great basket of warm breads , we ordered bottled water for all and a bottle of some sauv blanc that was mighty tasty . it was impossible to have an empty glass this night ! everyone had fillet s but me of course , i mainly had apps , side s , wine and desert i did try the seared ahi tuna it was ok i wasn t too impressed with it though . beefsteak tomato mozz see pics very yummy ! the creamed corn , sauteed asparagus and mash were all very good ! ! i couldn t talk anyone into the lobster mash or any caviar boohoo me . everyone loved their meal ! ! my g f was coming back from the bathroom and missed a step or something somehow she lost her shoe but there was a busser or someone right behind her he picked it up for her and even put it back on for her ! now that is what i call star service ! ! we had creme brle they served it with various fresh berries and a huge bowl of their fresh made whip cream yum gasm s were had all around . while mastro s is not my top choice since i am not a steakhouse kinda girl it was all good stuff . they always play some michael bubl and who doesn t just love him ! ? ! it was about bills total and we went home with doggy bags and full tummy s . p . s . i had their sweet potato fries they were good but i like the ones at fez better . . . . just sayin . o_o "
0,"ye olde pipe has a great selection of cigars and a very big walk in humidor , almost too big . i say that because as i walked around i came across a few boxes of cigars that were way too dry . with that said , i still found several cigars that were fresh and moist . what i liked best about ye olde was the variety , they had several cigars at all price points , so if you can t afford to smoke an opus x , they had plenty of cigars for less than . if you aren t an avid smoker , i don t know if you will get any help because the staff did not seem very friendly or welcoming , but if you know what you want , there is a good chance they have it .

1,"i was looking for a reco for a significant [eh hem] birthday dinner and foodie friend jim suggested mission because of matt carter . we had a res and parked right in front . . . fire blazing out front , nice feeling . inside , the decor is appealling but because of the lack of soft surfaces , its really loud . [full disclosure i did not inform them it was my birthday] we were seated along the banquette wall and were a two top next to a four on each side . noisy , obnoxious . server was very nice although stumbled over the bar order [and it turned out they made a scotch substition that they made no mention of] . had i not already done my yelp research i would have been at a loss as to what to order . we skipped the apps and had the swordfish and the pork . swordfish was a fine attempt but i thought over citrified and small bit over cooked . the pork tacos were genius . the combination of the pork , the sauce and the accompanying red onion , queso and cilantro on the home made corn tortilla just sang . the pork arrived as a glistening chunk that falls apart . well worth the and meant for two . you can also ask for more of the tortillas . we shared the churros and milkshake for dessert . deeevine . warm chocolate churros sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and an amazing milk shake that we really enjoyed . i d go back and sit outside by the fire and eat the apps and have drinks plates are small to begin with and i think if you expect a crazy wow dining experience , you ll be disappointed . i think the service is working out some kinks , the bar seemed okay [although the tv is this space seems well , off putting . . . ] and the kitchen seemed to be cranking . i do think its very fine food . .

1,"cafe monarch is more than a restaurant it s an experience . if i had to put an analogy to this one i would say that most restaurants are like watching a concert on tv and this place is like being in the front row at a great show . i was immersed in christopher s beautiful world and entertained the entire time . as camille h mentioned , this place may not be for everyone . there is no menu provided to pick things from . this is not a place for a quick snack , although , i bet if you asked , christopher would provide it . if you are a picky eater or have food allergies , call ahead of time . but if you go in with the mindset that you are going to be surprised with a meal full of the freshest ingredients , wonderful combinations of flavors and fantastic stories to every dish , you will not be disappointed . i am not sure i would bring my five year old to this place . she would enjoy it , but i think my husband and i will get most out of our dining experience with a babysitter . since christopher is a one man show chef , server , host , story teller , etc . etc , each course takes awhile , and my child s attention span most likely would not last through the entire meal . for a description of the amazing food we ate , please see camile h s review . she described everything perfectly . this is my new favorite place in the valley . i can t wait to go back ! highly highly highly recommend this experience ! ! !

1,never had a bad meal or a bad beer here . great selection of brews and the food that they make is simple and good . great recipe for success . service is a little spotty but expected due to the fact that these are college students who really speculating here and actually giving the benefit of the doubt don t care too much about customer service it s just a job to them . 
1,"this , my friends , is the place to get some very authentic chinese food . the servings are huge for what you re paying . . . shucks , they are huge no matter which way you look at it so be careful not to order too much food unless you want leftovers . who doesn t like leftover chinese food anyway ? my recommendations are the sweet and sour chicken , the egg foo yung and the chow mein . you will not be disappointed . you ll also find the soups on the back of the menu at an average of bucks or so . you will be pleasantly surprised when you get the bowl . . . it can feed at least people . she will bring small bowls out and serve it for you right at the table . give the hot and sour soup a try . as for the service , it depends on how you look at it . don t be afraid to get up and refill your own water . shoot , the waitress is the only one that s there , give her a break already . she must own the joint with her husband because there is always this little kid in the corner playing on his laptop . so , get your own water and your own take home containers if you want . she doesn t have a problem with it . yes , the place is a little worn but you don t go there to look at pretty stuff . it s not dirty , just broke down . you d be broke down too if you practically gave away your food in abundance to your customers . who has money for new furniture if you take care of your customers bellies . the lobster , crab and fish are fresh and cheap . try finding lobster somewhere else in the valley for bucks a pound , i dare ya . so , head on out , just don t go on a wednesday , that s their day off . they are open am to pm every other day though . you can call in your order and pick it up if you don t want to look at the place . oh yeah , and if you ever go in there and it smells horrid , it s not the place , it s a popular dish that some customers order called salty fish . it stinks to all heck ! if that plate comes out i usually pack up my food , giggle and finish my meal at home . i don t mind one bit , that s just the way it is . oh and the waitress does speak good english , however , you wont find many caucasians frequenting this place . that means the food is pretty authentic !

1,sometimes you just gotta have a burger . i was in the scottsdale rd grayhawk area and noticed this place where nick s used to be . i tasted their burger at the scottsdale culinary festival s burger battle and thought it was really good . the cb cb burger with tater tots really hit the spot for lunch . the burger and carmelized onions worked together really well . the tater tots were delicious . overall it was a satisfying meal and i ll be back soon .

1,"i know , i know . this gelato is a bit on the pricier side , especially when you consider that phoenix now has a bajillion gelato shops , that each offer a million and one flavors for a few washingtons . however , arlecchino is definitely the best . it s worth theprice , worth the drive , and worth the parking hassle . the owners are super nice and accommodating , and although there is a sample limit , the workers have never said no more . the flavors are classic , inventive , fresh , and authentic . plus , it s such a cute , tiny little hole in the wall shoppe , that you can t help but love it in all it s quaint glory .

1,"at the ripe old age of , it s time for my previous review to take a siesta . over the course of that three years , tempe camera s only gotten better . the selection s improved finally finding a happy medium between film and digital , the prices are even better than they were , and i dare say service on the retail side s kickass too . tcr is now my go to photo supplier as a working pro . they ve either got what i need or can quickly get it , they still know their stuff , and they support both local photographic education and the local photo industry . they re also the only dealer in the valley that sells think thank photo products , which are best damn professional camera bags ever . and if you re an amateur , they ve got plenty of friendly , knowledgeable staff for you too . don t be afraid to ask for someone else like almost anywhere , they employ people of varying personalities . there are sales staff i don t click with at tcr , but i wouldn t classify anyone as distinctly rude . if you want that , you ll have to try b h or adorama . if you need lots of hand holding , the asu crush probably means you ll either want to shop at off hours or go to photomark tcr tries , but the crowd to counter ratio just isn t favorable at peak times . repairs are still something they do very well at excellent prices . when i ve had equipment serviced , it s been turned around quickly , relatively inexpensively , and works like brand new . evaluation of your equipment is still free , as it should ideally be at every repair shop but often isn t . the lab s added a bunch of cool new services , including damn fine plexi mounting , and is doing a considerably better job with film than their old reputation for free scratches with purchase would suggest . hundreds of frames processed with nary a scratch to be found . rentals i m a little more ambivalent about . they ve thinned the herd out considerably about half the rentals inventory has taken up residence in the used equipment case and the selection of lighting equipment is basically unchanged , but they ve got the latest canon and nikon bodies , and everything s well maintained and in good shape . rates are good for what they do have the question s just if they have what you want .

1,"on one of my scottsdale excursions recently i got taken to delux by a friend who said they make , the best burger she has ever had . so obviously i had to put this to the test . we started with sweet potato fries which were served in a mini shopping cart which was entertaining . they were cooked to crisp perfection and lightly seasoned and still had the incredible sweet potato taste . i got to try the clasic delux burger itself and it was quite amazing , incredibly juicy and cooked just how i like it . we also got the lightly seasoned original fries as well which were just as good as the sweet potato ones . i also got to try the turkey burger which was also juicy and flavorful , along with the chicken panini which was incredibly tasty . it was a great lunch every one i was with enjoyed themselves and i am glad my friend recommended it . "
1,"my daughter and i really enjoy eating here . we tend to order the same thing every time because it s so good . she gets the grilled cheese and tomato soup combo and i get the grilled salmon nicoise salad . they both rock . it s cafeteria style all the way up to the point you pay , then you are served the rest of the way by a waiter who brings you your food and takes care of you . the food is always very fresh and delicious . and by the time we re out of there , it costs no more than eating in the food court but the experience and quality of the food are miles beyond . highly recommended .

1,i love that it s all a self serve line . you pick your yogurt and can mix flavors and then add any other toppings you want ! fabulous ! 
1,very good food with huge portions . 
1,"the sushi was fab ! ! we had some specialty rolls and shashimi , both were very melt in your mouth fresh ! service was a bit slow as i think they only had waitresses for the entire place . cost seemed to be very reasonable . would certainly make the drive from south scottsdale there again ! "
1,fun little place to just explore and try so many different samplings . the staff was great and super friendly ! the lemon cupcakes were amazing ! ! ! little tip buy a baguette to try all the great olive oils and tapenades
1,"had to go into scottsdale yet again , this time to the quaint scottsdale mall . well went there for a reason , after seeing jewel of the crown on pbs check please , i was hungry for some indian food . monday night not busy a couple people eating out on the patio , and a large indian family eating there , seems like they were talking about the recent demise of bin laden and they had their children there eating and studying , so i imagine it was all owners family . but they weren t annoying and well behaved . greeted immediately , felt welcomed and liked the look of the decor with a kind of strange old time piano music in the background , they served us some crispy , spicy rice ? cracker with two sauces . i really liked the taste of those . ordered the chicken tikka masala medium heat and we also ordered , oh what is it called , chicken something with spinach , and garlic nan bread . chicken tikka masala was very nice , it came in a kind of pot that was still bubbling . i like that , the only thing was i would have preferred more spice , so next time will go with hot and not medium . the other dish was decent but could have used a bit more kick , but that was ordered mild so that was our error . great iced tea , very refreshing and they kept it filled without asking . i wish i lived in this area , all the cool restaurants are in scottsdale ! ! son of a mother , why is that the way it is ? not fair . anyways , enough about me , i would definitely go back , heck i would even go out of my way from glendale to drive over and give it another try , it was definitely above average . the food was hot and fresh , with nice ambiance and service .

1,"a burger ? with anything i want ? fine . . . . i ll do it . i need no convincing for a burger , fries and a coke thanks carl s jr . earleir this afternoon , after a heavy morning of househunting with a couple realtors , i decided to sit my fat backside at a table and eat . and eat well . i stumbled into the five guys at the fashion square mall . not sure how long it s been open . perhaps it was the grand opening ? it was packed ! but i digress . as soon as you get to this location in the food court of the mall , you ll realize that this is not your typical burger joint . they have their own seating separate from the mall commoners . and their own bathrooms clean you get to the counter and you see a sign telling you about the potatoes they are using for the fries you will be eating . ordering your burger isnt a gong show . fairly easy . all the toppings are listed and all toppings are free ! my food was delicious . got a burger with some of my favorite toppings onions , tomatoes , etc . the fries reminded me of an experience i had back in high school , when i held a girls hand for the first time . soft , perfect and lovely . that s how these fries felt . ok that sounded weird . tough . oh , i forgot to mention that the soda fountains had coke zero ! ! effing awesome ! i mean this is the most dope soda ever ! ! i m really hoping this kanye yelping phase ends soon , since my reviews make me seem like a bigger jackass than i seem in person . ultimately , i left this place happy , satisfied and i will come back again . oh . . . the answer to the one question in everyone s mind ? yes , better than in n out !

0,i m always perplexed when the staff knows nothing about their on line specials . this time it was the yelp ad . luckily it was quickly resolved by the bartender this time which was refreshing . the place it s self is a pretty generic bar . i just had a few drinks along with the crab cakes which were actually pretty good . 
1,"i went here with a party of on saturday night and it was surprisingly dead . not that that s a bad thing because i don t like crowds . the place is pretty sheik but you still feel like you re in a hotel . service was fast and friendly but i think it was our waiter s first night or something . he was very awkward but it was ok . i was pissed we couldn t get the happy hour menu prices in the main dining room . i know it is common practice for crowded places full of douchebags , but the bar and the main dining room were pretty empty so wtf ? i m a vodka guy and their vodka menu is pretty neat . they have or unique vodkas from around the us and clearly list their name , where they are from and the price . what i didn t like was their martinis . pretty much the worst i ve ever had anywhere . tiny pours and full of ice chips . it was like a vodka slushy oh snap i think i just invented something ! ! ! . here is a rundown of the food bread to start excellent . . . love the lightly buttered and salted top tomato and mozzarella salad excellent one of the best i ve ever had . great dressing and ample balls of fresh mozzarella . pretzel fondue the pretzels were excellent but the fondue and mustard were no bueno . the fondu was gritty and the mustard lacked the kick that i love on pretzels . burger pretty solid but nothing special mac n cheese with shriner s sausage very unique and very tasty . it was worth having once but i wouldn t get it again . tater tots perfectly cooked . salty crunchy on the outside , fluffy on the inside . the only thing that would have made these better is some type of aioli or other special dipping sauce other than ketchup . the main dishes of the other people in my party looked excellent . i should have been more adventurous and gone with something more than a standard burger . maybe next time . i was going to give this place stars but i just can t . they try to think out of the box to create dishes that are unique , have fresh ingredients , and have a local twist . i will return .

1,great multigrain sandwiches . nice patio too ! 
0,i will start with our experience from the time we walked in . the customers sitting in the restaurant stared and some laughed . i guess we missed the whites only sign on the front door . however my husband and i love to try new things and don t care what people think . the hostess however was nice and pleasant . our waiter was also great . the food here was delicious for an appetizer we had the stuffed mushrooms which were to die for . our main entrees were the german meatloaf and my husband ordered the tenderloin . my whipped potatoes were so delicious . the cabbage was awesome not to sweet not to salty and the meatloaf was refreshing . my husband enjoyed his tenderloin and fries as well . it was seasoned perfectly . the skinny is if you don t mind being treated like the th amendment was never signed by the patrons of haus murphy s and want some excellent german food this is the place to go . the staff here were great though . 
1,"we were in town on business and pleasure and had a chance to visit aiello s with our children , and . what a tremendous experience it was overall and then to top it all off , a chance to win dinner on the house via drawing a number out of a bucket , was simply superb . we didn t win but will definitely come back next time we are in town as the food , staff , and overall dining experience was unbeatable !

0,"i am glad that i remembered this place for brunch this past saturday because it was good food and i love the atmosphere in the area as well . i went with my bf and we put our name in , got some coffee and was seated quicker than the time the originally gave us , which is great in my book . i had the breakfast burrito with chorizo . i wasnt a fan of it , it was good but not great . the chorizo really lacked flavor and punch . . . maybe i am use to the chorizo i get back home . my bf had pancakes with ice cream on top of it and it looked amazing and he loved it . i would come back and probably will to try some of there other things . this is not a place to go to thinking you will get in and out quick , there are almost always people waiting but the walk around old town scottsdale is worth it .

1,"came here on a thursday night and it was quite busy ! maybe all the snow birds are still in town . i made rezs and we arrived early , yet they had no plan as to where we sit . we ended up sitting on the patio . which would be nice in the summer or spring but , a bit chilly for jan . they had heaters outside . however , we were just a little to far away to feel them . we ordered a pitcher of the red sangria wine , which they said they were out , but alass when they saw how dissappointed we were they made more ! we were very happy about that so that gives them extra points . however , the sangria was loaded with ice and there was ice in the wine glasses as well which made us even more cold . skip the ice when it is in the s outside . we had the large capresse salad which was excellant . . . the basil and cheese were huge and very tasty . pizza was absolutly divine ! great crust , wonderful mushrooms , and excellant italian sausage . bathrooms were clean and parking can be a bit of a challenge . lacks a bit of atmosphere . the busboys were very attentive i give them extra points as well they were really working hard .

1,"there are few places that are delicious hole in the wall chains . in fact there really are no hole in the wall chains except two hippies and they do it right . upon entering two hippies you will see all kinds of crazy decor like a twister mat on the ceiling , chairs . . . on the ceiling , etc . your food options consist of burgers , hot dogs and tacos , where as your beverage choices consist of regular stuff like various sodas to flavored tea and lemonade . the flavored tea and lemonade is amazing , the flavor in the flavored teas is so good you don t even need to add sweetener , that s impressive . the food is equally as delicious , i had tacos one was fish not fried , baked tilapia so good and healthier and green beef , they have a red beef and green both are cooked with different peppers and marinades , the green beef was amazing i m def . looking forward to trying the red beef as well as the cactus taco which is just insane sounding . two thumbs up , bring cash though because that s all they take "

1,"it s and we re having lunch in the courtyard of our miami beach hotel . parker house rolls , sweet and salty , an open face meatloaf sandwich with mushroom gravy . there s a surf board and a tiki carving amidst the flowers . but wait something s wrong ! ! there s no humidity ! those are imported mushrooms in my gravy ! i work to orient myself in time and space and find , what a relief , that i m actually in cafe zuzu in downtown scottsdale and it s . the valley ho resort , which houses the cafe , is such a wonderful period piece . it opened in and was renovated in by a very wise design team that left the mid century architecture and spirit intact . cafe zuzu is at the far end of the lobby , and its charming patio is surrounded with flowers . the decor is late s . if you re as old as we are , you ll recognize it instantly . the menu consists of flavorful american comfort food . familiar favorites with a contemporary twist . there are goodies like warm maytag blue cheese fondue . , truffled grilled cheese , beef stroganoff , and gross tuna salad with cottage cheese which brings me back to my childhood a little too clearly . while waiting for our entrees , we received a basket of parker house rolls . these are the nice squishy white bread treats that , if you can manage not to eat them all , make wonderful toys . you can mold them into sculptures , or shape them into little round beebees to shoot through your straw . my meatloaf sandwich . was served on a thick piece of grilled white bread topped first with melty cheese , then the meatloaf , then the gravy . there was a mound of lumpless mashed potatoes alongside . they were so smooth ken wondered if they were made from instant , but they tasted much too good for that . the portion was huge , i took half home of course i knew i was going to have dessert . ken had sauteed liver , beautifully prepared , atop a mound of kale that had been cooked with high quality bacon , sauced with a madera reduction . he loved it . i surprised him by ordering a lemon meringue tart for us to share . there were several chocolate desserts that sounded good , but i had a vision of the mile high meringue toppings of my childhood . the tart had only modest swirls of meringue , but it had been made in such a way that it was creamy , as opposed to foamy , and it was really good . the lemon custard was the star . i remembered a gelatinous filling , but this was smooth and velvety , with just the right tart sweet balance . the pastry was a cross between cookie and pie crust , and stood up well to the filling . this was not an inexpensive meal , but the portions are large and quality is excellent . plus we had joined an organization called the lunch club , which every weekday , emails it s members a discount coupon for a restaurant in their specified zip code . so one of our entrees was free ! the discount coupons differ , some are off the bill , others merely are for a free drink . but , to pay cafe zuzu the ultimate compliment i d come here and pay full price .

0,"first off , it s fast chinese , and they lived up to their promise on that one , we did get our dinners fast . i am a huge fried rice fan and i have to say theirs was horrible , stick to plain white or brown rice . however , i had the beef with broccoli and that was ok . it s not like beef with broccoli is exploding with flavor anyways , so i can confidently say they didn t mess it up . what i do like about this place besides how quick our food came out is that you can do the meal deal , typically only offered at lunch , for dinner which gets you the egg roll and crab puff at dinner . i love crab puffs , again theirs was just ok and i didn t care for the egg roll all that much . overall it was fast , filled me up with a huge portion that i took home lots of left overs they were open kind of late until , and it wasn t the worse thing i ever ate . also , they had very friendly service .

1,"not too many video stores around . i will probably be joining netflix soon , but for now this place works as a video store . they have movies redbox doesn t have yet , in addition to older movies redbox will never have . the service has always been good here . my girlfriend has the mail in deal so movies are mailed to her then you can take those and exchange them at this place for different movies .

0,"four star average ? why ? this place is a chain restaurant with a silly name the family made me eat here and i will tell you this the only thing four star here are the sexy tall young fit waiters . . . . everything else is weak and salty . . . at least they serve bourbon but seriously the cocktail menu was silly and the preparation by the untrained bartenders was obvious silly rolls with honey butter oh that s cute the food was applebees meets outback one of those taste of the world menus my dad was silly enough to order the prime rib it looked like a swanson frozen dinner poor dad it is called white chocolate grill what does that mean oh it means we are silly and have duped people into thinking we are a trendy restaurant . so sad seriously the service is lovely and attentive the food is better prepared and home with more flavor and less salt i guess the real french fries the string kind were yummy but i needed to up my bp meds . oh and a funny decor thing they use rolled up , stacked utensils in napkins as sorta sculptural decor around the restaurant sorta weird"
1,"i love everything at market bistro , but i especially love the salads . i always get the create your own with their homemade and delicious buttermilk caesar dressing on the side . that dressing is totally addictive ! the other thing i would wholeheartedly recommend is the market pizza with goat cheese , artichoke hearts , oven roasted tomato , baby spinach , mozzarella , parmesan and basil pesto sauce . it is probably my favorite vegetarian pizza . you can get it by the slice at lunch , but have to order a whole pizza for dinner . i ve had the corn chowder with poblano chiles soup and it was great . i ve not tried the roasted garlic tomato soup but my friend loves it . had a sandwich here once , with tri tip with caramelized onions , but it doesn t seem to match the description of the ones currently on the menu . the only thing i haven t loved so far is their margherita pizza . everyone here is always nice and friendly . i love that it s family owned and still doing well enough to open another location . they now have online ordering , which i can t wait to try !

0,"dinning here since wings big and flavor full , special wing prices on monday . some of the biggest wings around , includes celery and ranch or blue cheese . four star wings . pizza delicious ! ! a medium is and the crust is thin , and foldable , new york style . . . with lots of hot cheese . four star pizza . fried zucchini complete disappointment , for . xx something you receive small zucchini rounds . chicken tenders dry , small , inadequate . beer , pitcher of ice cold , delicious draft . atmosphere mom n pop shop . . . this place permeates family owned . there are usually only people working , one in the front and one in the back . definitely the kind of place where you don t want to piss anyone off , and they might have a shotgun under the bar . . . service the waitresses are attentive and very close if you need additional service . will i return ? yes , i love those wings ! ! ! ugh . . . and the pizza , yum . i just won t order appetizers .

1,"by far the best asian market in the entire valley ! i first discovered lee lee s tempe location and was so happy when they opened this location in the west valley . amazing selection from produce , meats , and asian . the staff is super nice . never have had a poor experience in all the years . shelves are clean and organized . prices are great too .

1,"girlfriend and i always stop here on our treks to lee lee market . if you haven t tried pho pronounced fuh , this is a great spot . basically its a beef soup thats a thousand times tastier than campbells . its served with a plate of crisp and fresh veggies , like bean sprouts , jalapenos , basil , etc , that you can throw in the soup . i recommend using the spicy sauce that has roasted garlic in it instead of sriacha . we also had the lemongrass beef salad which was equally good . everything is fresh and tasty with great service . make sure you take dobson for the easiest entrance as pho ao sen is facing west !

1,"surprisingly well organized displays for a location that regularly gets mauled by roving packs of shoppers . great sales and service , a pretty solid seasonal selection but not as comprehensive as some of the larger anthropologies out there . the person who lays out the stuff at this store seems to space out the perfume bombs at a wider spacing so sensitive noses may be less battered by this store than some others in the valley . the clearance racks are gold mines for sizes . they occasionally have shoes , bags and swim items being sold at clearance there from in store returns . ladies can enjoy amazing clearance picks at the val vista and us location ! that location also has stock from previous seasons since it is so far out of the way of the typical anthropologie shopper .

0,we ordered . i had to return my chicken tenders . undr cooked and rubbery . my wife ordered a hamburger and is now home throwing it up . what a horrible experience . we have been huge fans and now this ? i called and spoke with someone who barely has a grasp on our language and they said they would get right back to me . still waiting my wife is in bed looking so sick . we will never return ! ! 
0,"i ve always wanted to go here . the flames outside intrigued me . so we went on wednesday night around pm . we were sat fairly quickly with no reservations for habachi . music is pumping , and the crowd is a bit older slightly cougarish . the service was . . . ok . he went missing from time to time . he brought me a diet coke after i had only taken a few sips out of my glass . i must of gotten new glasses by the end of the meal . soup . . . . is your basic mushroom miso soup . salad . . . tasty , spicy , had a nice kick . fresh crunchy greens . fillet and chicken . . . . eh . . . . i found the flavors lacking , the steak a little chewy , and the chicken boring . even the dipping sauces were lacking . for dinner plus tip for two . i think you can get better elsewhere . not worth the drive down to scottsdale , find a local joint closer to home .

0,"this is the other coffee plantation that i always forget about even though it is right by where i grew up . weird , huh ? actually , it isn t weird . because this coffee plantation blends into its stripmall surroundings so seamlessly that you totally forget it s there . they take absolutely no chance with decor or ambiance . for all you know , it s part of the laundromat next door . coffee isn t bad and it never seems to be too busy so it s actually an undercover great spot to get some things done without worry of distraction . not sure of the wifi situation , but a good book on a rainy afternoon and this place would suit you well .

0,"you know when you make a copy of the original and its not quite the same ? juts a little fuzzy around the edges , not as sharp but usable ? that is how i felt at the new location of market bistro . similar vibe that i enjoy at the original isn t quite as pulled together at this location . maybe the lack of a lounging area or the weird particle board chic tables ? or the fact that every table was dirty except one by the blast furnace front entrance . . maybe the grease dripping on the glass in front of the grill ? no forks ? i m sorry if i sound like a banging on mb . . but these are things that can be improved on . the mr and i shared a salad and a cuban sandwich . . the control freak in me of course got off on the salad making . . this was probably the best salad ive made to date . . you should be able to patent your creations ! the cuban sandwich was okay . . the ciabatta rolls are so thick and chewy that when you take a bite the toppings sort of fire out the back . . for a cuban sandwich i think it had some sort of asian spice , like cardemom ? ? anyway , the mr didn t like it at all . this being his first time he was confused as to why i went on and on until he took a bite of my patent pending salad , then it all made sense to him . the salads are just so complete and delicious ! i look forward to coming again . . i just hope that they can make a perfect copy of the original or go for a different feel entirely .

1,"here s an update , because the buffet is out at lunchtime only now , with a regular menu at dinnertime this old place continues to be one of my favorite restaurants in the valley , after years many visits . it s friendly , inexpensive , peaceful comfortable even with lots of customers , always satisfying . this time i started with a delicious bowl of menudo , a nice salad several kinds of fresh fruit , tasty cole slaw , then headed for the mexican hot table . had some spanish rice , refried beans , a beef taquito , an excellent beef tamale hand made , not some fast food thing pretending to be a tamale ! , more , but saving room for some chinese . the tasty treats over at the chinese hot table included terrific , big , meaty barbecued pork ribs , really good crispy sweet sour pork hey iain ! , just right fried rice , a steamed veggies dish in fish juice that included such treats as chinese snow peas , all cooked just enough , so on . what a great lunch for . !

0,"i love burgers and really wanted to love the grind , but it wasn t meant to be . unfortunately i had problems with the temperatures , both the restaurant and the food . i was here with my girlfriend on a tuesday night . the restaurant itself is nicely appointed , with a sleek , modern look and feel . it was pretty close to full , but staff were still friendly and efficient . the glass wine special they were running was very nice . i has the peppercorn burger with sweet potato fritters . the fritters were very nice , crunch without being greasy , and not overly sweet . the burger was nicely composed with great toppings and flavors the watercress in particular stood out . unfortunately , the burger was also well , well done , and i had ordered medium . i should have sent it back , but was hungry and didn t want to wait . for a burger joint missing a temperature on a burger is pretty disappointing and it killed a lot of the goodwill the rest of the ingredients had built up . the bread pudding for desert wasn t the best i ve ever had , but was nice and the bourbon sauce it came with was a nice touch . the other issue i had with the grind is the temp inside the restaurant . i ll grant that these are the dog days of summer right now , and i m sure it s hard to keep the place cool with the half open kitchen , but was pretty warm in there . with the wine special it was ok value for the money i guess . but on a normal night with glass for wine and for a burger with another for fries it s too pricey for my tastes , especially if they aren t hitting proper temps on the burgers every time .

1,"mims burger mexican food was revealed to me by my sister and sometimes when i think about it even when i just ate , my stomach growls . the restaurant itself just smells good sitting there and waiting for your food to arrive . the strange name would sort of , you know , ordinarily turn me off from trying the place because i think when restaurants serve this and this they usually just serve two wildly different forms of food , both of which suck . mims serves legitimately good mexican food , burgers , hotdogs and everything else . even if you re not in the area , it s worth going a bit out of your way for it . five stars . places don t get much better .

1,"definitely an awesome buffet . not your typical buffet stereotype . love the sushi . great variety of things to have . if memory serves , it was . when i was there . i think a tad high , but someone mentioned bucks , so maybe it s come down ? sake is priced well , and the beers . "

0,"third time back . this is my year old daughter s favorite restaurant for special celebrations . maybe because the portions are sized for her . just kidding . sort of . always good food . sometimes terrific . but never consistently , hit the ball out of the park good . the bill creeps up on you . we can t ever seem to walk out the door with less than bill for . last night , had the filet . at maybe ournces , bigger and more substantial than the last time , when i think i paid for ounces . seriously . last time the steak was perfect . this time , they overcooked it , but i didn t have the heart to send it back . so my wife ate it and enjoyed it , and i got her salmon . salmon was just okay . but , the bed of rissoto , one of my favorite dishes , was delightfully rich and creamy . overall , it s not a terrible value . and it s a cute little french restaurant . completely and totally not appropriate for small children , so don t even try . great date place . whatever you do , you must try two things onion tart it s just a slice and a side salad as an appetizer , but oh what a slice . berry tart the deserts are what makes this place go . save room . remember this if you go to a restaurant with tart in its name , and don t order a tart . . . well , what can i say . just don t do it . will be back , as i always have , and will promise to only feel slightly mugged next time i pay the bill .

1,"i am not happy with the co worker who introduced me to forefathers . do i really need another way to feed my addiction to cheesy , beefy goodness ? of course i do ! this small restaurant in a tempe strip mall has earned a special place in my heart . no , not just because of the artery strengthening cheese . it is home to the best cheesesteak i have experienced since moving to az . while the menu offers a variety of choices other than cheesesteak sandwiches chicken and even gasp ! salads , i stick with what i know and love regular with cheez wiz . bring your appetite , because this sandwich is big ! a generous portion of thinly sliced meat and that oh so important cheez wiz is nestled within a soft bun . it is gooey , drippy and messy . perfect . if wiz is not for you , it is also offered with white american cheese , provolone or mozzarella . while i prefer mine with just the basic meat and cheese , you healthy types can also get any combination of omg onions , mushrooms and green peppers . fries are a very nice compliment to the sandwich . let s be honest here , fries are a very nice compliment to nearly anything . forefathers fries . are hot , salty and crisp . if you haven t gotten your fill of wiz on your sandwich , you can turn those fries into cheese fries . . either way , be sure to grab a container of fry sauce i am guessing this is some blend of ketchup and mayo . one taste and you will want to put this on everything . lucky for me and my cholesterol level , this gem is nowhere near where i live .

1,"i pass by it everyday and my son goes to the daycare in the same center so i had been wanting to try it . i just recently started liking wine so of course i was excited about trying something new . we were greeted right away , and seated at a table that felt like we had to shout to one another haha . . . so we moved to the cozy little couch in the corner which was a improvement . intimate but casual and very comfy . . . and close to the tv basketball . they played sade all night which i really enjoyed . . . i love her . our waiter seemed kinda weird at first and he did forget about us a couple times . . . but he made up for it with complementary glasses of wine , so we forgave him . we tasted an ausi white wine but i didn t care for it . then we tried the gew rztraminer which i really liked . i guess i go for german whites ? ? ? but i ll be the first to admit i have no idea what the heck i m talking about when it comes to wine o but i do look forward to lots of learning ! anyway , we ordered the bruscetta for a little snack which were all very good . smoked salmon , mascarpone taramosalata dates drenched in soy sauce with spicy chorizo my nd fav , mmm spicy ! fig , prosciutto brie both our favs sun dried tomato , gorganzola walnuts we actually ordered the artichoke but got this by mistake , but we both liked it and i m not a huge sun dried tomato fan either i can t wait to go back and try more wine and more of the delicious sounding food ! crocodile , kangaroo , panini s . . . yum !

1," reviews ? guess there s nothing i can say about this gem that hasn t been said . we ordered the cheese pizza which is a really inexpensive but delicious tasting margarita pizza sooo good . we also had the vodka penne with tender big pieces of rendered bacon , tomatoes and fresh basil . the vodka sauce was creamy and seasoned very well . they included a ton of grilled french bread and cutlery because they knew i was staying at a hotel . they were really sweet and very fast at getting all that food ready for us . it says on their website and on the yelp search engine that pizza a metro delivers but they don t . not a big deal though the food is totally worth going to get yourself .

1,"this local restaurant is a gem . this is located down the street from the hilton at squaw peak and probably the best restaurant in the area that is filled with a lot of chain type restaurants . i had heard about the rokerij small plates menu from office workers and i thought i would give it a try . my girlfriend and i did not have any reservations , so we went downstairs in their bar area and ate the bar . you can order the mew mexican specialities or the rokerij side of the menu . there was so much to choose from so we decided to eat off of the small plates menu . we chose the small plates for . i was thinking the plates were going to be small and that we would not be filled . i appreciated that on the menu they told you how many pieces you were going to get of each item . the tenderloin on toast with triple cream brie was delicious . the amount of tenderloin was just right and the cream brie made it taste over the top . the scallops were cooked perfectly as well . thoroughly enjoyed the taco sampler . everything is fresh and the service was great . the couple next to us ordered off of the new mexican cuisine side . the servings were ample and looked very tasty . i have heard the menu for brunch is equally fanstastic , can t wait to go back !

1,"i love me some coffee . the french roast brew is perfect for surviving a long day of work . if you want something sweet , order the iced raspberry mocha . just the right amount of sweetness without tasting like you re drinking syrup . the muffins are moist and delicious . the spinach salad here is surprisingly amazing yes , they make spinach salad at this coffee place . the best part about this place ? it is not full of hipsters and college students who hog all the decent seating and never leave . i can t wait to go back to try all of the other drinks offered .

0,"and then it all changed . . . i think this is my very first review that has been demoted to star after being on the coveted star for a long time . so , where do i start . after feeling dog sick for a few days , i finally decided to walk in to this place because that s what they do now supposedly . they take walk in patients who are seen by the np . i signed in at and was not called in the back until am . then i waited another minutes for the np to come in and see me . by the time everything was over , it was am before i walked out of this place . i asked to talk to brenda , the office manager and was brushed off twice . supposedly she is going to call me but would not see me when i was there for two and a half hours ! i guess she didn t have the balls to face me at that point . what could she have said really ? the front desk lady did a screw up and let another walk in patient go before me even though he came minutes after i had already signed in . when i pointed that out , she said he came before me and i had to show her the sign in chart . instead of apologizing , she just kept doing what she was busy doing without acknowledging her mistake . when the np did come see me , she missed a couple of key things in my chart that she totally should have asked me about . i was quite appalled . i had to point out a deathly allergy that i have even though it should already be in my chart . my final analysis in my opinion , don t go here if your health and time are valuable to you .

0,for my hubby and i on a saturday night grimaldi s turned out to be pretty lame . the restaurant is decorated well and the hostess was friendly enough but the actual pizza was sooooo boring . i seriously took a bite and wondered if i had missed the slice altogether . i will say i tasted a lot of garlic but that doesn t count for much when the pepporoni is bland and the sauce is useless . now i m a deep dish girl at heart but i ve had amazing thin slice at classic italian pizza in tempe . this place made me feel like i wasted my money and i woudn t ever want to bring anyone here including myself again ! 
1,"any time i have out of town visitors who want real mexican , i take them here . the chips are fresh , the salsa is divine , and after downing two baskets , you realize you need to eat an entree ! i ve eaten a variety off the menu , and nothing has disappointed me . the burros are stuffed full , the crisps are mouthwatering and the enchiladas melt in your mouth . the only downside is the location . just not a great part of town , though they are trying very hard to revitalize it . go there anyway ! just try lunch time first .

0,"i hate the heat . hate . yet i am doomed to reside in this heat haven so when my best friend raved about a place where you can sit outside in arizona and not feel the heat i had to check it out . by the time i ventured downtown to glance at this place phoenix was experiencing a cool down so the patio was very comfortable without the fans and misters . our waitress was great and even chatted about our night and my favorite bar , sidebar . we got the l . b . favorite lavosh and i okayed the bacon even though it didn t sound too appetizing . it wasn t . i ordered some chicken sandwich that was on a french roll . the salad on the side was better than the sandwich . my friend ordered the classic turkey which was large but average . but i think ordering the classic sandwich was a boring mistake of its own . the fries that came with the turkey were greasy and when i ordered a amber ale and some guy brought a pale ale . i like pale ale so it wasn t too bad but it made me yearn for the amber . yes , or course i ordered the amber next . the waitress told us that the island bar was opening the next day but there were still ladders and paint cans lying around . i failed to notice until my friend mentioned it . the only really cool thing about this place is that it is in a historic building with strange bathrooms . other than that i would skip it .

1,"copper star is a great example of adaptive use in the heart of the melrose curve . who would have thought that a building initially designed to provide fuel to cars would so work so well serving fuel to humans ? their coffee is locally roasted and , while not my favorite , is well above average in phoenix . their drive thru is a great feature for those mornings when i m running late . for the coffee adverse , copper star serves chai , tea , smoothies , italian sodas , and some unique drinks including a black cherry limeade . foodwise , there is a wide selection of baked goods , including some of the best bagels . they also have decent lunch offerings , such as sandwiches and a tasty hummus platter . but where they shine is their home baked cupcakes . i ve seen mayor gordon here on several occasions getting his cupcake fix ! despite being in a converted gas station garage , the atmosphere is quite a bit more cozy than most of the other coffee shops in central phoenix . while the sandblasted block walls and exposed ceiling let that building s industrial past peak through , this is offset by rotating art work and selection of comfortable if a bit dingy couches and easy chairs as well as small bistro tables and long work tables to choose from . the staff is friendly and helpful , and the owner , bill , is a great neighborhood resource . he can tell you anything and everything going on along th ave . all in all a good place to grab a coffee and cupcake , meet a friend or get some old fashioned reading done . i can t recommend it for serious work requiring internet access , however , as the wifi access remains intermittent at best .

1,"oooh been here once for dinner and about three times for lunch . . . it s really a great place for a quick and easy meal and it s not too fatty like other fast foods . . and it s pretty cheap . i love their piece dark meat rotisserie chicken that comes with a delicious cornbread i m usually not fond of cornbread and two choices of sides . i ve had the creamed spinach , corn , veggie mix , squash mix , roasted herb red potatoes and sweet yam which is my least favorite . . . . the sweet yam casserole is just too sweet for my taste . . . so not a big fan of that one . . other than that the other sides are pretty good . the meatloaf meal is also really good . . . two really good size slice of meatloaf also with a choice of two sides and a cornbread . . . bucks more expensive than the chicken but sometimes you want something besides chicken . heh so for a quick easy cheap semi healthy meal that does not consist of a hand full of grease burgers , pizza , tacos of that sort . . then boston market is really a fantastic choice yummers !

0,"we visited frank albert s on a sunday afternoon for lunch . hardly anyone was there , as it was about pm . we had eaten lunch there a couple of years ago on the patio , and i had a great time then . however , the temp was on this particular afternoon , so the patio wasn t an option . we were the only people in there other than the dude who talked on his phone the entire time we were there . he even managed to order and eat his entire lunch while yapping . i ordered fish tacos , as i had the last time we were there . something has changed . a previous reviewer mentioned this , and he was on the money . i received two constructed tacos . . . soft tortilla shells in the shaper with cabbage etc . only no fish ! two large ish filets of fish were on the side ! it was really messy . . . i had to tear apart the filets with my fork , smash some fish into the full of cabbage tortillas , and complete my own taco i gave up on the second one and ate the veggie taco and the fish separately . i really didn t like the seasoning on the fish , either . i thought it was too harsh and blackened . ultimately , the fish tacos were meh to say the most . i will not order them again . my bf ordered a sandwich and since he must follow a special diet , he cannot eat mayo . he reads ingredients very closely and requests things he can t have be left off . his sandwich came slathered in mayo , even though it wasn t mentioned on the menu as an ingredient . when we looked around for our server , he was nowhere to be found . so , while i munched on messy tacos , bf sat looking sad for the next minutes until we finally saw the server and flagged him down . that being said , the server was awesome about making the new sandwich sans mayo , and we even received an extra order of sweet potato fries with sea salt . they were yummy ! and when you see their house chipotle ketchup , do try it ! i looked for it in the biltmore gift shop , but they didn t have any for sale . oh well . i am not swearing frank albert s off forever , but since i am only in phoenix a few times a year , it will be a while before i go again .

0,"i don t know if it tastes like chicago or not but it s reasonably safe to say that the stuff is cooked to order and consistently greasy and overstuffed , so maybe it is like chicago ? the atmosphere is cool i guess , but i m a bears fan so it s cool seeing the old memorabilia on the walls . "
1,i did not know i could still be creative since it had been years since i had done anything that involves even a minor level of creativity . but what fun was this ! a girl friend took initiative here to organize a kitchen tea on a recent saturday afternoon . we were a table of girl friends that were scheduled for some pottery making ! my initial idea of this venue was admittedly a little different but better than expected in so many ways ! for one we did not have to get all that dirty . not dirty at all really . also not that i mind dirty . this is for those who wonder whether to go or not to go . and two we were able to bring along our own food and drinks which made for excellent responsibility sharing in the wining and dining arena . once we were set up with our party arrangements and have had some snacks and champagne we were inspired to start our artistic journey . the idea was to have each of the friends make a dinner plate or item of the bride to be s choice which we will then give to her as a wedding present . i thought this idea was really original . so the bride to be selected her dinner plates of choice after which we were briefed by a very friendly and sweet staff member as to the different effects that the paint will have once the plates were baked . all informed we went to select the different colors we needed for our different art works . everybody started painting and each one of us got really involved with their own creation . the event took us much longer than we anticipated but in such a good way . we finished about hours after starting off but much enlightened by the activity . everybody agreed that we will have to go here again for the sheer enjoyment and good feeling of togetherness it promoted . i have not yet seen the end product as one of our friends went to pick up our designs but we will presenting our collective gift to the bride to be soon go go here for a stimulating outing with good friends family kids ! 
0,"absolutely waste of time space is this establishment . don t bother checking in with the host to be seated as i saw many people just seat themselves although there was a min wait for others , the staff rude , uncaring could possibly be where all the servers go that can t get a job in any other resteraunt . a complete disgrace i would never give such a place my hard earned money , i suggest you do the same .

0,"i have received two pedicures and a manicure from this location . i usually prefer a more spa like experience but the cost is low and i was attempting to save a few dollars . cutting cost may not be a good thing to do when it comes to body care . i won t be returning because i am concerned about health violations . pros quick service cheaper than the spa , salon cons improper cleaning of foot baths . i thought they were good until i saw them seat a women at a used station . they only took the sprayer and rinsed the dirty bowl . i did let her know the foot massage was more like a foot beating . about an hour later my ankles felt like i had rolled them . it took almost two weeks for them to feel normal again . the sent in the shop is of fake nails . if everyone has on a mask , i would like one to .

1,"bruce saved my day , my computer crashed this morning and i gave him a call and he was able to come out same day . he went through my whole system at my office and even updated my anti virus with a free avg instead of paying for that crappy norton service . he was able to go through and recover all my files and found out the operating system was corrupted . he saved my day and completed everything same day . thank you bruce !

0,"food was ok . servers ok but cashier was horrible ! ok , some people are just not meant to work in the food industry . at least smile ! place had a very gross smell ! at first we thought maybe because we were sitting kinda close to the restrooms but the farther we moved from there the worst the smell got ! maybe if i m desperate enough i will go back !

1,"i like buffalo . they always buy my stuff , and i like looking around at what they have . i think the reason a lot of people don t like this place is because they try to sell ugly nasty shit that no one wants to wear . it s a recession , so , you re not going to get top dollar for your j crew tee shirts that you bought years ago that have pit stains and are hideous . duh .

0,"i called the town dump to ask if i could come in this week and interview them for an english paper about a small local business , and the owner was just incredibly rude . she didn t even let me finish telling her it would take five minutes of her time , preferring to interject and tell me to go somewhere else . when i explained that i ve heard wonderful things about their business from friends , and that that sparked my interest , she said , well , go somewhere else . i ve never even been inside , and i sure as hell won t go now . maybe it s just me , but i don t like shopkeepers who snarl at their customers .

0,"waffle house was packed , over heard another couple taking about fast eddies , with a min wait ahead of us we decided to try it out . walked in looked like a senior center . tables and chairs were very out dated . we sat down in a booth . food was still on the table and the cushions were dirty . waitress came over after min and asked what we wanted to drink . min later she brought out or coffee . placed the order waited another min to get the food . the diner wasn t busy at all . i don t know why the wait was so long . the food was ok , service was horrible . one thing that really grossed me out was the a c return next to the office door . look up and you will see probably years of dust that has collected . i showed the waitress and she really didn t care . i told her that if i would of saw that when i came in i would of just walked out . gross ! sorry waffle house i will never betray you again .

1,"impossibly good italian deli in the middle of the desert . huge sandwiches on the most incredible bread you ve ever had outside of ny . as someone who ate here times in a hr period , i feel especially compelled to tell you about their cheesesteak . ho ly shit . easily the most decadent , flavorful cheesesteak i ve had in a very long time and i live minutes outside of philly . im still in disbelief that they could pull something like that off . ask for yours on the soft roll . i should also mention the sausage , peppers onion sandwich , which was really good . i suspect they make their own sausage , which elevates them to superstar status in my book . the chicken parm sandwich and dinner are both equally good , and the meatball sandwich deserves honorable mention as well . i dont do cold subs , but the ones i saw coming out of the kitchen looked huge and tasty . perhaps i will try their pizza next time i m in town .

0,"singray is pretty good . the location is nice but there is never parking due to the other businesses around . not fun walking so far in heels . the sashimi was pretty fresh , but miso was a little too salty . also they gave us cold oshibori towels when we sat at the sushi bar . i think i prefer the new pure sushi location next to az . once i was able to find it . very modern cool feel and awesome food . heard stingray is opening another location by my house . biltmore area maybe parking will be better .

0,"we went here for a family dinner . our family is loud and boisterous but not obnoxious . we asked to be seated in the bar since some of us wanted to watch the game . no problems so far . our waiter was really nice at first , but seemed flustered and as if he wasn t getting the help he needed to keep up with his tables . i waited tables for years and this guy was nearly literally scrambling to keep up , a sure sign of not enough help or lack of teamwork . of the two hostesses , one of them could have bothered to help him out by refilling water , tea and soda for us , but alas they did nothing . we waited so long for drink refills that my husband got up and saw a pitcher of coke on the bar , so he poured himself a glass , which he was scolded for ! i could not believe it , i was shocked . a guest should never be treated this way . if anything , someone should have apologized to my husband for not giving us what we needed for the meal . the chips were good , and they kept them coming , so props to them for that . they are served with bean dip and salsa . i liked the salsa a lot , not spicy enough for me , but a good amount and mixture of yummy stuff , including cilantro which i find many salsas don t even contain ! to me , it is not salsa without cilantro . the teensy bowls of salsa they bring though need some rethinking . they should either bring one per person or consider a bigger size . it s only about tablespoons , and that aint much salsa beware , some sides of rice and beans also come in these super tiny containers three or four bites and it s gone ! anyhow , we ate tons of chips and salsa because the food took so long to come out . our waiter sort of apologized for this by keeping us updated that it was actually coming . . . . . someday . our food came out a good minutes after we ordered . sadly , two meals were completely missing in action and the two of us that ordered fajitas which came out of the kitchen very cool , not even the slightest bit of heat from the iron skillet or the meat had to wait at least minutes for their tortillas , so they couldn t even eat what was at the table , which was getting cold . after the two missing meals came out , one was the wrong meat , red meat instead of chicken . more waiting . . . the table eats , minus one . when everyone is nearly finished , the right chicken taco dish comes out . it was delicious , but overpriced . the chicken was nicely grilled and the tacos were served the way i like them , with a little bit of onions , more cilantro , lettuce , lime and pico de gallo . they also came with cheese , but i don t like cheese on tacos . they came on tiny little corn tortillas , which themselves were good , but way too small to make decent tacos that didn t fall apart . plus , i ran out of the tortillas before my meat and other stuff was gone . our waiter was really nice except for the scolding i m still floored by that , so i can t decide if he sucked or the place sucks , or maybe they both do . . . we definately won t be back .

0,"my sweet tooth was yelling at me ! i had to stop in . four times to date and each time i try something different . other than the cheese curds which where just ok each visit was for the frozen custard . very rich and creamy a little goes a looooong way . i have tried a small berry sundae , a pineapple malt , and a small black cherry cheesecake concrete mixer . the sundae by far has been my favorite . i love the simplicity , the berries were not overly sweet , strangely artificially thickened . the malt was nice and malty which i really appreciated and was rather thick even after melting slightly . now the concrete mixer was the richest of the rich . maybe it was because i decided to go with a cheesecake flavor to which you can add any other fruit or topping flavor . it was very tart like cream cheese about as tart as a good greek yogurt with small bits of graham crumbs swirled through and of course the blackberry flavor .

1,"some buddies and i went to scottsdale for a golfing boondoggle last week and a couple of guys in the know directed us to the mission . dang ! we let our server , jonathan , drive the car so to speak . he quizzed us on our likes and dislikes and brought us our orders we didn t specifically order . we had people in our group and every plate was spot on . we started with the chicken thigh tostadas and the crispy cola pork belly tostadas . they were great particularly the pork belly ones . man were those good . my dinner was the chorizo porchetta which brought a big hunk of slow cooked pork that shredded beautifully . along side this hunka hunka porky love was a salt block carrying small corn tortillas to build little tacos from . some tasty accompaniments sauce , onion , cilantro , finished the presentation . it was a fantastic dish . the other dishes were just as great . to note the honey chipotle grits that my buddy got were super tasty . especially when you dumped some of their ghost chili sauce forget what it was called . desert was the pumpkin bread pudding yum ! and fried bananas . all in all , a fantastic place . really good .

0,"amanda b organized a uye for dim sum here today . they do dim sum from a menu instead of carts and it works really well . they also have a picture menu to look at with many of the items on it so folks like me can have a better idea what to order just by picking the picture of stuff they liked on a prior trip . we were pretty much the only folks there for quite a while and we had the full attention of the staff . not all of the staff is fluent in english but i can only recall that being a problem with the tea . i liked my choices a bit better this time , experience helps , and marian h was helping me with sauce pairings as there were several to choose from . i almost gave them a but for the restroom . the fixtures had a lot of corrosion around them and in general the restroom showed a lot of wear . i flushed the urinal and was washing my hands and it seemed like the running water was very loud , i looked over at the urinal and the valve had stuck and the place was indeed flooded . i beat on the valve with my fist until it rocked back but by that time the floor was quite deep in water . i mentioned it to the hostess and they had someone in there with a mop quickly . i would definitely go back here again .

1,"the really interesting thing about this preserve is that it s in the middle of gilbert . you d never expect to find a nature preserve tucked between the unassuming gilbert public library and track home neighborhoods . yet , it s there , and it s quite a gem of the east valley . they have multiple things going on all times of the year , from guided bird watching to night time observatory star gazing . the preserve is a little sanctuary of nature and beauty within the confines of our sprawling metropolis and i absolutely love it . what i especially enjoy is how the gilbert public library looks out to the preserve with its giant floor to ceiling windows . so even when it s sweltering in the dead of summer , you can still go to the preserve and enjoy the beauty while reading a book in the library .

1,"another place that is really serene and makes you forget you are in a large city ! i really liked the desert botanical gardens and i am totally not into flowers or botany ! we had been to dbg once before for luminarias , but it was so dark that we couldn t see much . i m glad we returned in the daylight . we took my inlaws yesterday after brunch and they absolutely loved dbg . my father in law is totally into photography , so dbg was awesome for him . we saw tons of people with cameras , so it is a photographer s haven . i really had no clue there were so many types of cactus . there are hands on activities scattered throughout probably for kids on field trips and boards with information , which comes in handy on the sonoran desert trail when you want to figure out which mountain in the distance is camelback , piestewa , four peaks , etc . we saw little lizards , hummingbirds , quail , and ground squirrels while wondering around as well . there is much to see and you can get through the gardens as quickly or as leisurely as you would like . we spent about two and a half hours there , which i think is a perfect amount of time . you see everything and are ready to leave by the end . a very nice place to take visitors on a nice day .

1,"what a great place to hike run shred ! it s a great hike to shake up the routine with . a steep hike with bits of scrambling to a summit with amazing views . the only downside is there s mad crowds of people snaking their way up and down the hill . i feel for humanity sake i must pass on some words of advice . if you need to pass just say excuse me or on your left right or , if those don t work , can i pass ? don t frustrate yourself and huff and puff behind someone because they can t interpret your grunts . the railing sections . yes , it s steep but if you see someone running down using the railing and trying to go fast let go and let them pass . there s this thing called gravity and it will keep you firmly on this earth . trust me you re not going to fly off into space nor topple over backwards . then you can grab the railing and pull yourself up if that s what you need to do . i can t believe i have to mention this don t freakin smoke on the trail . apparently there are some who can t savor life s moments without puffing on a cigarette . but if i see you smoking as i hike this thing i will be forced to kick you in the shins . i can t help it it s what happens when i inhale second hand smoke . your trash does not add to the ambiance . pack out what you take in . this includes dog owners . pick it up . nothing will decompose because this is a desert . just sayin finally , sometimes in life when we arrive to our destination and find the parking lot full one must consider finding other options . yeah , you in the suv waiting with the engine running for a spot at the nearest stall to the trail head . park down the road and walk up . ridiculous . happy hiking !

0,"durant s has that old , musty , dark , mafia feel . love the atmosphere and allure . we mainly sit at the bar , but have dined in . the happy hour specials are good , and we have tossed a few back here having great talks and enjoying the ambiance . now for the bad the food is overpriced for it s quality . the steaks look fatty , the salads wilted , and flavor pretty bland . it would probably be okay if we weren t looking at plus dollars per entree . back in the day , durant s was very high end and elite , so i could see the pricing from that perspective . however , if they want to stay in the game , they need to keep the food up to par as well . stars plus for ambiance , relaxation , a throw back feel , and great drinks ! star for food and food prices . however , a major landmark in phoenix , so please check it out ! we never know how long these staples will be around . i would just recommend going for drinks and maybe split an appetizer . it does ignite the romantic mood and will leave you reflecting on those good old days .

0,"i can t help but feel the same sentiment as nathan s . i sort of feel bad giving this place only stars with all the other rave reviews . let me start with the positives i love love that the place is so small and intimate . especially in comparison to most valley restaurants that are just cavernous . and with the european style seating you have to get friendly with your neighbors . both of these things make this feel like a good ny restaurant . i also love the atmosphere and decor in general . very authentic spanish , very laid back , not all hip and modern like most restaurants try to be these days . the service was extremely friendly , from the hostess to all of the waiters and waitresses and bus boys that came by . my husband really liked the sangria tinto he said it wasn t very strong but tasted great . indeed , all of the food tasted very good . our two favorite dishes happened to be the daily specials the eggplant barcelona and the turkish custard dessert . but the tortilla patatas and the gambas and the spinach with garbanzos were all great as well . now to the negatives firstly , selection was dreadful all around . the wine list was very minimal , and the very limited bar didn t help . and there were only about dishes to choose from . when i go for tapas , the whole point is having a wide variety of small plates to choose from ! every dish was drowned in oil . literally , bowls of oil . the food just sat in my stomach afterwards , and i felt like i needed to take a shower to rid myself of all the grease . the sizes of the dishes were very inconsistent . i know it s tapas , and i love me some tapas , but generally at tapas places i find you could likely split each dish three ways . the gambas and the spinach were both huge piles that could have been split up to ways . but then the tortilla patatas was barely large enough to split two ways , and then our two favorite dishes the eggplant barcelona and the turkish custard were both smaller than a deck of cards and splitting them just two ways left us each with a single forkful of food . there was a party of next to us that put in order of the pork tenderloin and the waitress said , you should really get or orders of that so everyone can try some . orders for people to try it ? ! then , right along with the food size is the price . incl tip for the tapas mentioned above , plus a glass of sangria , glasses of wine , the dessert , and an espresso . of the tapas were one bite per person . yikes . the food , while good , was nothing outstanding . there was no dish that made me stop and say wow , now that is well done . they were solid but not amazing . as opposed to the lomo embuchado at cobras y matadors in la that i was ready to marry and make babies with . so all in all , i d say a . star experience , rounded down because it just wasn t a for me . i can t help but compare this place to my favorite tapas place in the valley , sol y sombra in the dc ranch , where they have a huge selection of fantastic wine and a full bar and a huge selection of delicious and much larger portioned tapas for the same price .

0,"i haven t yelped in about months , and i was waiting for a place to either wow me or disgust me . well , this place was that bad . first impressions were all right the outside bar was neat w good views of downtown , and the fire pits were nice . no beers on tap though and seriously , what s with the hip hop club dj at pm ? come on guys , way too early for that . it wasn t too long before three of us were seated and after about minutes , our waitress came up and asked us whether we were ready to . . . oh wait , that s right , no menus yet , good job . o . k . , so i ordered the thai spring rolls , which had a filling of lettuce , a single strip of carrot , and noodles . seriously ? ! main course , i ordered the curry , which turned out to be the worst curry in the world i don t even know if it was curry it was more like a bowl of thick , yellow soup , with a few pieces of chicken and a couple of vegetables tossed in . yuck . and then they only gave me a tiny bowl of rice . i m sorry , isn t it supposed to be the other way around ? my friends completely agreed with how bad the place was i think they had some sort of stir fry , which they said was bland and pointless . so yeah , i don t recommend this place . instead , head a block over to the roosevelt for some good beer on tap and some pretty good food .

1,great date place ! i was worried that i wouldn t like what they picked for me because i don t like vegetables but the chef worked right around that . the cheese plate was very good but the bread that it came with was fantastic ! ! the short ribs were great . i loved all of my wine pairings as well . 
1,"just went tonight . was looking for some late night mexican food and atmosphere a step above most things that are open this late and found success . this place is definitely trying to pull off cool and i think they do a pretty good job of it . their expansive selection of tequila , enhances the mood they set out to create . i do not like that you had to pay for chips and salsa but the food was pretty cheap for how nice the restaurant was , so i think it evens out . they might charge for chips because it s the kind of restaurant where you could spend several hours drinking and if people ate chips the whole time that was happening it wouldn t be profitable . i say this because their alcohol is a good deal . oz . dos equis for four bucks on tap and it wasn t happy hour ! this place is a balance of modestly priced mexican , drinking and nice atmosphere . the food is not amazing but it s good , and with the atmosphere and wanting to eat at at night this restaurant bar is overall impressive . if weren t for the late late night aspect would probably only give it three stars "

1,"true fine dining has come to the valley . if you are looking to have a special dinner , this is the place . and plan on spending hours as it is a true culinary experience . the tasting menu consists of options of , , or courses , and they can be paired with wine , if you like . this is the way to go and even for tasting portions , they are not micro mini . the choices for each course are extensive . at least each . and , the coolest part , is that you won t find any ingredient repeated twice . none . yes you might find tomatoes in the same night , but they won t be the same type . that s not easy to pull off , considering the variety of the menu . but , while you are between courses , chef binkley will send out numerous amuse bouche which , if you don t know , are tiny little one bit or one gulp appetizers like , mini sliders the size of a half dollar , or pancetta mousse in a shot glass . we ate there for my ex h s bday , and had amuse bouche . also , if you let them know in advance you are there for a special occasion , you will get custom printed menus for everyone at the table mentioning the special event . the only drawback , is the atmosphere . it definitely doesn t fit the quality and beauty of the food . but , i still give it a , as the food is superb . if you are a true foodie go . i was excited the whole meal , as i couldn t wait to see what came out next ! if you are a meat and potatoes type with an uneducated palate , save your time and money , since you won t appreciate the menu at all .

0,"so , clearly the musician s make the night . our night was not so hot . half of the bad that we caught wasn t worthy of stage time , the other half was . the horn players were exceptional , the keyboardist wasn t . i ll stick to the facility . the rhythm room is a phoenix , classic on the music scene , or so i m told . this was evident when paul reed showed up with his horn and just joined the band on stage . that was cool and made you feel like you were in the right place . beyond that , i m can t really claim that this place is worth the time . we ll have to try it again to confirm , yet my urge to do so isn t high right now . the neighborhood is questionable . the entrance is not obvious , the bar and the service are not inviting . the music area of the building is excellent . you sit very close to the band . the one thing they need to fix within that is two sets of band doors would allow for a much faster setup teardown between bands . we waited for an hour between bands . the rhythm room is missing an opportunity here , they need a comedian or something the fill the gap . some fresh eyes on how this place is run could really make some simple improvements . just because it s a known classic doesn t mean that it can t change for the better . the one thing they have right is that the sound is good and if they re getting good bands , then it makes for a great night . the annoyances only become obvious when you have an hour to descern them between bands . the musician s interaction with the crowd before and after shows is really cool . this makes everyone involved feel like they re in the scene .

1," if the melting pot exists , the cheeseburger may well be its most palpable product to take a bite of it is to take a bite of history . . . elizabeth rozin , primal cheeseburger who could argue with that statement ? checked out delux burger today delux is a burger joint that gets some serious buzz and numerous best burger awards from the local media . they are also a late night favorite since they serve food until am . this gives them street credit in my opinion . the mystery dining companion , otherwise known as l . joined me for this burger excursion this evening we arrived around pm for a late supper . the seating is a bit cramped in the dining room and the patio . the delux menu is very nicely limited , meeting my personal rule for just do what you do best . we both ordered the signature entree , the delux burger . , starring a half pound of freshly ground harris ranch beef supporting cast includes a toasted demi baguette topped with maytag and gruy re cheeses , sweet caramelized onions , applewood smoked bacon and organic arugula . we also ordered the combination fries a la cart which came out before the burgers . the fries were fantastic ! they were served in a mini shopping cart making them easy to share and included french and sweet potato fries . two sauces were also included with the fries , a standard ketchup and a house aioli which resembled a thousand island type sauce with some kick . the burgers came out shortly after the fries . they were impressive looking before we took the first bite robust in size and the beef was perfectly cooked . delux recommends to order their burgers at medium rare allowing them to showcase the juiciness of the beef l . and i ordered our burgers medium and they were prepared perfectly . as we bit into these works of art , the beefy goodness oozed wonderful flavor onto our palate . the beef truly is the star of this show , however supporting cast complements it nicely without taking away from the magnificent flavor of the beef . this burger really hit the spot . i was able to command and conquer this burger , however l . was only able to master one half and took the other half home . adam from man vs . food would have been so disappointed with her . a few other good factors that delux offers good service , fantastic beer selection , which are primarily microbrews from across the country , and reasonable prices . if delux has a weakness , it s an atmosphere that s a bit trendy and possibly even slightly pretentious , but the burgers are so good that it s overruled . overall , a fantastic experience . . . and another bite into burger history .

1,"parking nice lot , good amount of spaces and good lighting . curb appeal strip mall bar and tavern clean entrance , no major issues . big tinted windows on the side facing elliot to keep the sun out the front looks like strip club not a bad thing , just sayin it has glass block windows and a solid oak door . layout cool layout right side is a large dining room with good amount of tables and some booths . off to the left of the entrance is a large u shaped bar with plenty of high top tables surrounding it . on the dining level there are numerous booths and table tops . ambiance very clean , noticed that a table stayed unbussed for only a few seconds before it was taken care of . good sound system , lots of tv s showing variety of sports . i can only vouch for the mens room , but it was actually really nice . good clean area with lots of room , plenty of soap and towels . food my group had a little bit of everything on the menu . sliders were actually good , wings were good with healthy amount of sauce get the maple hot . . . different but good . drinks plenty of beer on tap and at a good price . even pbr for your hipsters out there good micro and import selection , but not great . staff this is were they earn the th star . awesome . everyone was friendly and seemed to actively look for ways to make the visit more special . the skinny this place is good . i d be comfortable bringing the guys here for some football or happy hour beers . . . and it s equally comfortable if you want to bring the wife girlfriend husband whatever for some drinks and some fun . i suggest you give it a chance and don t let the dive bar reviews get you . i ve been to a lot of dive bars , and this place is a few steps above that for sure .

0,use to be the best pizza in town . unfortunately that was like years ago . now this place is overpriced at about for slices and a drink . trust me you can find better pizza almost anywhere and they charge for ranch as do most pizza places . but isn t a pizza joint charging for ranch the same as a burger place charging for ketchup ?

1,yen has amazing sushi . i would say that they have the best sushi in az . you have to try it to see how amazing it is . the service is great and i feel like i just stepped into japan . the whole sushi experience is very authentic and perfect place to hang out with friends or take a date d there is only one thing i don t like . sometimes it get s to busy so make sure to get there early around p . m if you want to be seated right away . 
0,"other than being a little overpriced on some of their items , it s really good food . i ve tried the pesto linguine , fettucine with marinara , grilled cheese with tomato and arugula , linguine with alfredo sauce , caesar salad , their chocolate and vanilla cupcakes , and their chocolate chip scone . the overall price for two adults with medium drinks is always about . i wouldn t go there all the time , but every now and then i get a craving for their bread they serve with all their pastas or one of their cupcakes .

0,"i stayed here in march and thought the place was alright , nothing to rave about but here was my experience pros . location was good for what i was there for work . the nightly rates were really cheap this had to do with my company more than the establishment though . easy enough drive to from the airport . you can almost bypass phoenix altogether getting to scottsdale . . their was plenty of shopping places about a mile and a half up the road think best buy , target , mcdonalds , etc . . . . a pretty happening restaurant bar up the street that gets two thumbs up . the rooms were actually really spacious and nice . . . it was like having a luxury one bedroom apartment scaled down for size full kitchen , massive bathroom , den seating area king size bed in a comfortably sized room . . hot tub was rockin nobody gave us a hard time about having glass bottles out there . cons . once i checked in , i had to lug a ton of stuff over to a room in the one of the back buildings and i couldn t see my rental car maybe i m weird . . . but i like to have my car close by . i unpacked and got situated to find that the internet in my room wasn t working must have ! , called the front office and they had to move me to an entirely different room mind you i just unpacked . . . agh ! . i ate dinner a couple times with co workers in their lounge , while it was good . . . it wasn t great , so we all ate at the restaurant bar up the street the rest of the time . . be aware , you stand a decent chance of see spiders looming around . . . so you have been warned , but otherwise it s real clean . i d stay here again pending that i got the same room rates that i did last time , but it s my understanding having talked to the girls at the front desk that we got booked at unusually low rates . don t get sucked into any of that time share crap . . . they don t push it like some other places i ve been . . . but it s never a good investment "

1,"i can only vouch for the chicken salad , as it s the only thing i ve ever tried in the years i ve been coming here . it s that good . i always think about trying something else , but why mess with perfection ? walking inside gives you the sense that you ve stepped into a time machine and arrived in the late s . i , personally , find it to be awesome . most of scottsdale is lacking in historic flare . and yes , the late s is historic by scottsdale standards . besides , whatever money they re not spending on updating the decor is clearly going right into their magically delicious chicken salad .

0,"so the place has christmas lights , and a fair amount of ambiance , and supposedly there s a shirtless shot at which might make going back worth it . other than that , the service was less than lackluster , the domestic kegs all seemed flat . in other words , go somewhere else unless it s and you want to see some daytime nudity .

0,"i don t expect much when grabbing lunch at a mall , but i expect better than this . the seaweed salad was a generic overly soy tasting disappointment , the rainbow roll was barely worth eating the shrimp on the roll tasted fishy , the fish was mealy textured , and the rich was soft and too sticky . the yellow tail roll suffered from the same , and we luckily were cautious enough not to try sashimi . the miso soup was served barely like warm . the tea was served barely luke warm . that was when we finally got service , which took a veritable eternity . tea refills ? good luck on getting someone s attention for that . the inside is a dismal , cavernous sport bar pool hall sort of feel . basically no redeeming features here .

1,"where to start ? ? ? the owners are very kind . . . say hi to benny in the kitchen ! ! ! my wife and i found this place while living in the culinary void nw valley of phoenix , and we have eaten here probably times over a year period . everything is good gryos chicken pita souvlaki greek salads are probably one of the best salads that we have ever eaten fries are always fresh zatsiki sauce is stellar the atmosphere is a bit void , but people don t come to th and thunderbird for the atmosphere . . . they come for great food at a great price .

0,"dined here last friday night . i know this is considered one of the better chinese restaurants , but i am struggling w a vs star rating . the eggrolls , pot stickers were good . pot stickers are actually quite stuffed . i got one of the chow mein dishes w the noodles done hong kong style , fried . the dish itself was fine , but the noodles were weird . part of them looked like they had not been put in oil and fried adequately . . . they were dried and stiff . i pulled that bit out onto my extra plate . the daugher liked her kung pao chicken . hubbie s shrimp dish was good too , but the broccoli ringing the dish could have been cooked just a little bit longer . . . it was pretty much raw . table was a little sticky . ultimately , i felt i could go to another chinese restaurant and have a similar meal , maybe tao would be slightly better ? or tao is slightly worse ? i can t get past those noodles . yuck . i think ultimately if i m in the mood for asian , i m not gonna go the chinese route . go to asian for me right now is anise .

1,"let me first explain that we came to the place on a bad night . . . apparently , one of their regulars literally drank herself to death spent a week in the hospital before whe finally died . instead of a funeral , her husband and family set up a memorial at her favorite bar . . . the place was filled with long hugs and sobbing . . . all while the gal s husband was hammered and wobbled leaning on the end of the bar . sad , sad , sad , sad . . . . . . on so many levels . . . . . . . . . that said , we just tried to stay away from it all . . . and our server bobbi hope i spelled it right was really great in keeping happy , warm , and chatty . ignoring the other patrons that night , then , this place is definitely a great little legit irish pub apparently the oldest in the valley for you history nerds ! firstly , they have all sorts of irish food items cottage pie , corned beef and cabbage , bangers and mash , beef stew , seafood , and they even have a boxty . we tried a couple different things that were all tasty ! next , almost all of their beer taps are dedicates to irish or uk beers guinness , smithwick s , harp , kilkenny , magner s , newcastle , etc . . . . . . and they know how to pour a stout ! they didn t have live music that night apparently , they normally have live irish bands nights a week . . . but they played a great array of real irish music the whole time ! i read a couple reviews that claimed it s not an authentic irish pub . . . . . . but i m guessing these folks haven t spent a whole lot of time in ireland ? understand that any bar , in america , has to have cheeseburgers and chicken fingers because you re not in ireland . . . that said . . . . . . if a bar plays irish music . . . has of taps dedicated to irish and uk beers with the other irish or uk style like killians , kiltlifter , and sam adams . . . has all sorts of irish food on the menu . . . real irish signage not shamrocks . . . proper stout pours in two parts . . . plays irish sports on tv . . . supports the local irish clubs . . . . . what makes it not a legit irish pub ? this place is about as legit irish as you ll find in arizona . . . and worth a visit !

0,"playable muni track for players of all abilities . if you ve never played golf , this would be a good course to learn at . for low handicappers , it s birdie paradise . kenny mac has a large chipping green and two putting greens , as well as a driving range equipped with crappy range balls and mats which i refuse to use . the course itself is wide and flat , and is certainly not a destination golf course . the fairways have generous landing areas and the rough is hardly penal , while the greens are mostly accessible and large . during the summer time , the fairways run out and the course plays extremely short . bonus star for having lovely cart girls .

1,"thanks to chris l s first review , otfm has been on my list of places to go for quite some time . unfortunately , i just can t seem to get my act together on saturday mornings . today was the day . i was ready by am , not pm ! after a quick stop at the atm , we were there , yelp canvas bags in hand , and not disappointed . i had to get that chocolate cherry bread from phoenician bakery . i sampled an itsy , bitsy little piece and it was still like heaven exploded in my mouth . we also purchased zucchini bread , honey which i ve already mixed with some mascarpone cheese and slathered on strawberries , grapefruit marmalade yum , dates , and fresh flowers . the breakfast burritos from gil s taste of taos were some damn good burritos . saving for next time . . . fresh produce the lines were already long for mcclendon s and i m not one to wait for veggies and everything else i wanted like tamales . we saw our own gabi k s other half wandering down the street too . . . he looked so lost without her hope he brought her some flowers .

0,"taberna and ninfa s are owned by the same restaurant group out of houston . is it a coincidence that the ftr for taberna is by someone who has only reviewed both of these spots and gave each five stars ? i think not . here s my objective review taberna is in the scottsdale seville where roy s used to be . they have a large outside patio that will be great when the weather is nice . i ate lunch at the bar and enjoyed chatting with the friendly bartender . the menu is upscale mexican food . i liked the basket of chips they brought out to start . it came mixed with chips and plantains and two nice salsas . i also ordered the al carbon steak enchiladas . they were good and spicy served with what i believe was a mole sauce . overall the quality of the food was good but a little expensive . i would come back , but it s not at the top of my list .

1,had my snaaz k walk for education very beautiful park ! ! ! clean and would be perfect for walking a dog ! there s lots of parking and also there is a desert in downtown phoenix how nice ! real arizona feel ! i would definitely take my parents or my aunt for a nice walk on a fall morning 
0,the employees here are really nice and i like the island feel . the food is pretty good and i like it because there aren t many other places in town with hawaiian food . i also like that you can get beer here . 
1,"before i shop at whole foods which is on the same lot , i buy organic produce at tj s because it tends to be much less expensive . also a fan of the delicious frozen gluten free pancakes , the organic vegetable pizza which you can microwave in a pinch , the gluten free ginger cookies , the should be illegal they re so delicious lemon madeleine cookies , and the canned cat food , which has a minimum of junk . hubby also loves their frozen chocolate bananas . i just wish that all of the tj s stores stocked more organics .

1,"just had an early dinner with the kids tonight kids eat free from pm btw . i had the prime rib and my wife had the fish special , kids had the mac and cheese . all were great meals . the reason to go here is to sit on the patio , it s fantastic ! not impressed that at pm i had to valet , when i m with the family , i d just rather park and walk needed to walk off the prime rib and wine anyways ! . this place is not cheap , and with glasses of wine , there is no happy hour at the restaurant !

1,"this is a great place to go for a glass of wine and appetizers with your girlfriends . my girlfriends and i went there to celebrate one of our birthdays . we sat on the patio by the fireplace . our waitress was awesome she let us try as many samples of wines that wanted to . the wines are very good and pretty inexpensive . as for the appetizers they were just ok . the bruschetta is good , but the spinach artichoke dip was tasteless . this place stands out for its ambiance , great tasting wine and good service !

1,a yummy mexican sunnyslope dive . the oatmeal horchata is tasty ! the torta is really an experience ! 
1,"the building itself has that frank lloyd wright s vibe going on . . . not my taste , but our city isn t very old so i can live with this minor aesthetic annoyance . remember when they almost tore the orpheum down ? not cool . fight to keep history here folks . . . anyway , anytime i hear people begrudgingly ask what is there to do in phoenix ? i would have to suggest we do have culture here , if you re willing to venture outside of your comfort zone and outside of the suburbs . phoenix is privileged enough to have an opera company and ballet company who are great at what they do . i saw the nutcracker most recently and goodness , they all had impressive resumes . the conductor , and costume designer were definitely stand outs . as audience members we are supremely lucky because the venue itself is small enough to ensure you will have a fantastic seat no matter where you are . i will go back . i can t wait to go back . my soul craves this , as should yours .

1,"i have been to this place twice so far . the first time i had no idea what to expect since i never heard of it before . i honestly have no idea what to compare it to but i guess the closest thing is texas road house judging by the reviews here on yelp . anyway , i know its not the classiest joint with the best food , but anything is worth a fair shot . the first time my wife and i went we were in the area doing some shopping and just wanted something quick and casual for dinner . we didn t expect anything great but to be honest our expectations were exceeded . the happy hour is pretty good . pints and for cocktails wine . both times we went we ordered a for drink which would have been ok if they didn t charge too much for the first one . i mean for a small glass of yellow tail ? they are giving you though so i can t complain too much i guess . the thing we love about this place is the meals for . special they have going on . there are some pretty good options if you stay away from the fried stuff . so far we have had the chop steak , steak and the salmon . they are all very good and decently sized . they prepare them however you want sauce on the side , etc . and everything comes with sides . there are or so sides to choose from . i get a side salad and some grilled onions or mushrooms to go with whatever meat i am having and they are always very good . my wife always gets some sort of grilled vegetable and they are good as well . the service is very fast and friendly and the food always comes out pretty quick . oh yeah , and i also am a fan of their peanuts as well as the rolls that you get to start .

1,"i love fate , and have been there dozens of times . i agree with a lot of reviewers about the attitudes from the girls who work there . they act as though you are a bother . i can t understand why someone would work a job they hate . the food though , is incredibly tasty , and has plenty of options for vegitarians and carnivores . i like the hipster atmosphere and the food a ton . the drinks are weak , and overpriced , but the food reasonable . this translates over to next door where they charge bucks for a well drink . they also treat you like scum . i m only giving this restaurant a because i pay a lot more attention to food quality and taste than i do service . i also love the fact they are open late . i work til pm most nights so its good to have an option that isn t fast food .

1,"holy crap thomas is spot on , hilarious . the first thing i thought when i first walked in this place was i m feeling mighty little . big heavy pieces for sure , dark woods , carved , unique . you need a big space to show off this stuff . lots of mexicali knicker knackers . i still have a few pieces with me here in hotlanta , but it doesn t quite fit anymore . . . . anyone want to buy it ? shipping is only , . . . .

1,"what a menu ! my boyfriend loves sushi and i don t eat seafood , so going to these types of restaurants can be quite disappointing . however this place has the most extensive menu i ve seen at a japanese restaurant that is known as a sushi bar . the ambiance in the place is really romantic at night with dim lighting , nice music , and delicate plating . all the little details in the decor , like placing the chopsticks on a polished river rock was beautiful . their menu offered everything from chicken and beef to lots of seafood . i ordered chicken teriyaki and it was delish . their sauce tasted homemade and was lighter then most which i loved . it came plated nicely . i also had their tempura which was light and airy as it should be . the dipping sauce , also heavenly . my man seemed to enjoy his sushi and it looked nice as well . overall it s pricey compared to other sushi places , however the ambiance of the restaurant and upscale choices on the menu make it worth it .

1," stars ? definitely ! upon walking in , everything from the atmosphere , decor and staff was warm and inviting . we each ordered a course meal , and agreed on different selections . the addition of a homemade mozzarella appetizer and an amazing dessert meant we each tasted dishes that night . amazingly unique and delicious dishes . we tasted from every section of their menu , including raw butterfish and albacore , cooked gnocchi and risotto , and meat short rib and pork belly . pretty much everything was my favorite , and a couple of glasses of barbara complemented the meal perfectly . it was pretty quiet on the night we visited . . . if i may make a suggestion it would be to go go go to crudo . like , now .

1,"http stevelerer . com i traveled to phoenix only a few days away from the la marathon in march and was determined to start carbo loading early . my first stop was matt s big breakfast , a place i had patroned back in . that time i ordered the item that guy tried on triple d and it was really good . he ordered the chop and the chick which was a pork chop and two fried eggs . it was delicious , with a great pesto topping , i only wished i could have had more pesto but they may have given it to me if i had asked . the restaurant is small usually with a minute wait even for one person . i didn t mind and hung out with the locals for a little bit before i was able to sit at the bar . the decor and ambiance is not much different than most other small breakfast spots but it is clean and welcoming . the staff was nice and took my order quickly and it was only a short while before my order of the hog and the chick was in front of me . placed at my spot of the counter was beautifully cooked think cut peppered bacon , crispy hashbrowns , and two perfectly cooked over medium eggs . everything on the plate was cooked really well and was a perfect breakfast . the eggs were right under medium which is where i like them and the hashbrowns were crunchy and crispy on the outside while still creamy on the inside . somewhat like a potato latke , just without all the onion . by far the star on the plate was the think cut bacon . sometimes when a restaurant says that the bacon is think cut it really isn t and other times it is so thick that it comes out uncooked . matt s got it just right and peppered right to the edge of too much . just where i like it . i could have eaten platefuls of this stuff , if only they were in la at the end of the marathon . the last thing in my order was the real reason i returned to matt s . each breakfast arrives with a side of bread of which you have a few options . bread aside , the start was the strawberry jam they served on the side . the jam is without a doubt the best thing in the restaurant . it is super sweet with chunks of fruit inside . it has so much flavor in such a simple concoction , i could eat a jar of it . too bad they only give you about two ounces . i wonder if they bottle and sell it because i would buy . all in all matt s big breakfast is a really solid breakfast joint in downtown phoenix . no wonder it always has a wait . the peppered bacon was delicious and the rest of the meal was nothing to scoff at but , in the end , i would come here every time i visit phoenix just for the strawberry jam . check out matt s big breakfast the next time you are in town and let me know what you think . overall review "

1,"standing like a paragon of virtue in a sea of decadence , u . s . egg s scottsdale s location is place of redemption , both for your soul and your appetite . open only for breakfast and lunch , the restaurant attracts as diverse a clientele as the dale itself . this is not somewhere that relies on being a tourist trap some locals are known to eat here daily . its location is slightly outside the old town pale , but still within walking distance unless it s the height of summer . secondly , it has its own parking lot , making it as accessible as denny s or a marie callendars . nevertheless the lot is often full on weekend mornings , and you will definitely see people waiting . unless you arrive very early or late . there is both an outdoor patio seating area and a large indoor dining room . having gone numerous times alone , i am always impressed how quickly i am seated . no bias against tables for one here . the servers are all personable and graceful . . . yet not self aggrandizing . this is not a michelin four star restaurant however , and you should not expect being waited on hand and foot . given the volume of service , it s also commendable how few mistakes are made and how prompt everything is . the food is also excellent . although you can order both lunch or breakfast , i tend to crave the latter more . there s plenty of variety on the menu and they have both innovative dishes and old staples . this helps to explain why the uber fab scottsdale club kids patronize this place just as much as the cadillac set . prices are very reasonable for scottsdale , though perhaps too much for a dirt poor college student or person living only on social security . the building also capitalizes on arizona s sunny weather with high ceilings and plenty of windows . . . causing plenty of light to splash in and helping to evoke that sense of morning and freshness . there s plenty of ambient noise as a result . . . but it s almost reassuring . not to mention that the hearing aid crowd and club crawlers may be too deaf to notice . u . s . egg is not flawless , however . from a cost point of view , the restaurant has to contend with the fact that breakfast is usually the cheapest meal of the day . without a dinner menu though to recoup cost , diners have to grin and bear any perceived cost imbalance from say denny s . neverthless it s still worth it , in my opinion . the other shortcoming stems from the food . different dishes often rely on the same sides . if you get sick of their potatoes for example , you can be really out of luck despite ordering something different every time . moreover their signature dishes again may not impress truly demandng foodies . while it may not cure your hangover or incontinence , u . s . egg remains firmly on the map for locals . managing to please all of scottsdale is a tall order , and the owners , managers , and staff all should stand tall and be proud .

1,"my daughter began taking classes at encore years ago . at the time she had a bit of an attitude and didn t do too well with other girls . she instantly fell in love with regina and took numerous classes from hip hop her first choice to ballet , jazz , and lyrical . i watched my daughter blossom into an amazing young woman as well as an amazing dancer . regina involves the girls and boys in the competition experience so that they have more opportunity to learn confidence and self esteem . my daughter has had the opportunity to travel to california and las vegas with the studio to participate in nationals and master classes . encore is not just family owned , it is a family environment . i checked other studios but found a less than friendly welcome to new participants . i couldn t recommend anything more than encore and the skills that your child learns . my daughter now works at the studio as well as dancing and my youngest daughter is taking her first classes now . i am looking forward to another years or more with the encore family .

0,honestly i don t get it . i went to dos gringos with a good friend of mine last weekend . i had never been to phoenix before so i was excited to see what the city had to offer . after entering dos gringos we sat at our table for minutes before a waitress came to our table . she brought us beers and never came back . after minutes we decided to check out a new bar since we obviously weren t welcomed at dos gringos . so we went up to the bar where i waited for minutes so the bartender could take some pictures and shots with her friends . what i didn t understand was there were maybe only people there and at least people working . if i was the owner or manager i would be embarrassed to say that you run that establishment . i will never return and i highly recommend you stay away from dos gringos as you will be disappointed .

1,"we ve eaten at taneko twice now , and while we like it , it s awful expensive for what you get , and i prefer a more authentic japanese environment . taneko starts off wanting to be a japanese style pub restaurant , but ends up throwing way too much scottsdale into it creating a rather pretentious yet still yummy restaurant . the food is excellent i enjoy the pork meal that has the stupidly spicy mustard sauce . my kid likes the fried rice , though it is a little too much on the ginger side . there s a gimmicky hot rock appetizer where you cook pieces of steak on a super hot rock . it s way too expensive for what little meat you get , but it s an awful lot of fun . the service is excellent as well , though maybe a little too servile for my tastes . the wait staff go way out of their way to make you comfortable and quickly take care of any needs . i just don t care for all of the introductions i m not going to remember the names of the or people bringing me stuff . still , i think that s the scottsdale influence . not bad , but not really my thing . overall , i ve enjoyed both of the meals that i ate at taneko , but with better places to eat real japanese food like yasu , sea saw , hiro s and even sakana , i m probably not going back real soon .

1,"home to the mariners and padres spring facilities , peoria sports complex is a pretty great place to take in the action . i have seen a decent number of games here over the years . most recently i saw a weekend game sitting out on the lawn . it does not get much better than relaxing on the lawn , watching some baseball , hanging out with your friends , and getting some color in the degree heat . the practical details there are a ton of food options . maybe too many , if you believe in such a thing . food of all kinds is everywhere . you can get all the standard ball park fare and some more exotic things , too , like noodle dishes , sushi , fry bread , etc . ticket prices are good sit up close for bucks on down to the lawn for bucks . you can t beat it for getting up close to the action parking is only bucks in the lot , which i think is really decent , but if you want to walk a little further you could find street parking across the street . best deal in the park for a oz . soda with unlimited refills . a large one is and not as big , so if you get even two this is a great deal . on the hot day i was there we filled the sucker up three times and once more before we left . well worth it . in short , if you re doing the spring training thing definitely come to peoria . it s super relaxed and one of the best places to enjoy some baseball . you will want to keep coming back !

1,"so i am not usually in the tempe area , but a friend told me about this place . so i though i would go try it out . i got a grande latte that was around . not a bad price . but what made it worth it was that i guess this friday i went was a free shot friday . so i got an extra espresso shot in my latte making it a triple for bucks . . . no that is a deal . not sure if they always have the promotion on fridays . but it sure did make my morning a little better . their menu is very easy to read and give those no too educated in the was of coffee a good description of what each drink is and how it is made . the had a ton of great looking pastries even though i didn t sample any . cakes , eclairs , scones , and i think even what looked like cheesecake . the decor was very interesting . an old fashion coffee house meets a gypsy vibe . i think they have wifi too . i saw a few people on there computers . the service was a little slow i think . felt like i was waiting for my drink for minutes and the place was not really that busy . this was probably because of the guy ahead of me when i walked in who had about different modifications to his drink . i have worked in a coffee place and those people are kind of annoying . so i will let them slide on the time of service . overall a great experience . would have been stars , but when you get something for free , in my book that is an automatically another star .

1,"i absolutely love club sar ! i joined back in i think . . . . at first , i just went there with my ex who lived in so cal and had been boxing because i have always loved the sport of boxing and wanted to get into it myself maybe even join the boxing team . sadly , i exceeded the age limit to join the boxing team , by a few years . . . but , at least i could still learn and get fit . we just walked up to the entrance and just took one quick look around and it seemed crowded and small so we were not impressed . so , we left . i found out this used to be just a boxing gym before but eventually they added other classes and equipment for others to enjoy . glad i went back later on my own and found out how affordable it was ! i checked and tried a few other fitness centers and gyms nearby but , when i decided to actually try one of club sar s boxing classes , i was hooked ! for a mere a day drop by fee , i was able to get one of the best workouts i ever had . i joined after i found out it only cost for the whole year which includes all the classes i can take boxing , boxing conditioning , yoga , spin class , kickboxing , weight training , mma . . . yes ! mma too , which i personally love . . jonathan carlos are great and so is tom . they re funny , friendly , and they actually remember you after only a few classes . the pricing has gone up this year but it is still by far , the best possible deal you can find anywhere in the valley . fees yearly membership resident non resident adult years child years daily drop in fee residents non residents if you are serious about getting fit , staying in shape and getting a good old fashioned workout without all the posing and pretentiousness of other gyms which are more like meeting places and meat markets for the young scottsdale wannabes , this gym is definitely for you ! personally , i recommend the boxing classes because they will kick your butt , they are fun , get you fit and , in shape . they just got new heavy bags so there are heavy bags , hooks bag , several bob bags , double ended bags and speed bags in the main workout areas . plus , a bunch more standing weighted base heavy bags in the other kickboxing yoga room . and , in case you didn t notice from the picture , a full size boxing ring . yes . i am totally endorsing this gym ! p . s . this is a no frills , serious gym . so , no whinnying and crying . suck it up and do some push ups ! call them for more details "

0,"i work in fine dining , and this place would have failed any shoppers report . the server never introduced himself and was negligent in attention to us . the food portions were so small i was very disappointed that they charged so much . management was scared and hesitant to check in on us and primary paced the restaurant dreading any social interaction . my biggest concern and reason i am bothering to write this review is the portion size . and perhaps it was just what we had ordered , but the hamachi was barely more than two bites and the dinosaur salad was just cheesy large kale pieces . drinks were tasty . if ever i go back , it will be for their bar only .

1,"i tried pork on a fork at the asu tempe farmers market . beef brisket and pulled pork sandwiches were sold there in a small tent . my sandwich brisket was very tasty , albeit a little plain just meat and bread . there were three great bbq sauces available sweet mild , tart , and spicy . i used a lot of all three , but spicy was the best . i felt like i could drink those sauces ! at , the sandwiches are a little pricey , but they are filling and taste excellent . it would be nice if they came with some corn , beans , or the like to round out the meal .

1,only a mexican food snob would undrmine such a great traditional restaurant and believe me we have plenty of those here in arizona . this is old school mexican food folks and it s about as good as it gets . the atmosphere is classic and i personally enjoyed it but it is not upscale but then again mexican food normally isn t . it s simple and that s what arriba s is . if arriba s were located in any eastern state it would easily be the best in the entire state . the beans were great the salsa was delicious and the service was fast .

0,"wish i could rate negative stars . . . . with so many bar choices this place is by far the worst . last saturday a group of friends went out for a friend s birthday celebration in scottsdale and decided if we split up that we would meet at the end of the night at loco patron . it was increasingly obvious that the staff was hostile and irritated that they could not close up early . we finished our last call drinks and started to head out . the friend who was celebrating his birthday waited behind at the bar until his friends left the bathroom . at this point two bouncers became extremely agitated at our friend and demanded that he put down his drink and leave . my friend started to explain his reason for not leaving friends still in bathroom but was quickly cut off . i watched from the patio as the two bouncers both obviously larger in height and weight then my friend quickly escalate from talking to both grabbing my friend under the arms and start to carry him out . as he was carried backwards he lost his balance and tumbled back with both bouncers on top of him . the bouncers slammed him down headfirst on the cement outside of the establishment , pinned him down with their elbows and hit him . at this point i had run behind the bouncers and was yelling at them to get off of him . i had already taken out my phone to call and i quickly tried to take a picture to show that they were using excessive force . we demanded to see the manager at which point the bouncer said he was the manager and refused our request . he swiped my friend s phone down out of his hand and broke it on the ground . several people had called at this point and we waited outside for the police to arrive . the police arrived and took down the bouncers information and stated that they would be recording this incident . i am absolutely adamant in saying that neither i nor my friends will ever frequent loco patron again . we were treated disrespectfully by untrained staff who were either too eager to close up to get home or get a power high by manhandling non threatening , non physical patrons of their establishment . based on the behavior of the two bouncers i assume that this bar operates without any written guidelines on how bouncers should conduct themselves . what i witnessed was full on assault and an infringement on human rights and i plan on writing any regulatory agency i can think of . these people make a bad name for all of the bouncers out there that conduct themselves within the guidelines of the law .

1,"always a healthy , fresh meal . one of my favorites is the hummus and grilled chicken appetizer which is gynormous and i have them add in some tabbouleh , then cucumbers on the side . perfection . all the pitas , and the seasonal specials are always super good . wine is also inexpensive if the mood strikes . otherwise , great casual lunch and dinner spot that is extremely reasonable in price for the quality of food you are getting . there is something for everyone here , veggies , kids , etc . if i ever moved from az , this is the first place i would come visit upon my return . parking can get hairy at the arcadia location , and one time someone actually backed into my car when i was legally parked along a curb but that is hardly pita jungle s fault . the douche didn t even leave a note but i digress and karma is real and nothing would keep me from coming back to pita !

0,"i went to this place with my wife because it was new and we re always looking for new places to eat . we were the only two people in the place and would have thought that the owner , to make a good impression and show gratitude for what business he did have might have come by the table to ask how the food is , make small talk or anything . he sat at their front counter watching a baseball game when we got there . the waitress took our order , he went back to cook it and resumed his place at the counter to watch the game . we felt like we were putting the guy out to have to pull away and actually cook for the only two customers he had . as far as the food is concerned you can grill a great burger at home with decent meat and the fixin s you want to put on it . in other words , it wasn t anything special and certainly nothing that i would go back for . bottom line scottsdale doesn t need another . burger place and i wish the staff could have put more effort to appreciate our patronage .

1,"i think i m in love . if i only lived closer to downtown phoenix , i d leave my mark on the lost leaf in the form of a permanent intaglio of my ass cheeks on a bar stool . it s tucked away on a side street in a humble looking home cum art gallery cum bar . it can be a little tricky to find since no sign exists , so keep an eye out for the neon lit open sign . you definitely don t want to miss out on this place by becoming frustrated after fruitlessly ducking down side streets , saying fuck it and going to the roosevelt . while it wouldn t be a total bust , you d be missing out on the warm and inviting ambiance of the lost leaf . that s really what won me over about this bar . it made me feel downright cozy , with exposed brick and wood , local artist s artwork decorating the walls , and the actual kitchen serving as the bar . the main room is large enough to host a large group , but small enough to be homey . the acoustics are very good soft talkers rejoice ! and the music playing was loud enough to add to the mood , but nowhere near the point of drowning out conversation . there are a couple rooms in addition to the main bar area that you can duck off into for more intimate conversation , as well as an outdoor patio that s a little on the small side but , super score there s ceiling fans ! i found the prices to be very reasonable and the service to be unpretentious and helpful . there are no beers on tap here , but the selection of bottles is mind bogglingly extensive . i had to ask the bartender to get me his favorite pale beer and i ended up finding out that i am also in love with a brew called . looks like a wine cooler , but manages to be respectable instead of laughable . so bring a couple friends with you and indulge one night , and then another , and another . you ll be love struck too .

0,"chain restaurant that s just about okay for afternoon dining with friends . if i wasn t having beer at lunch i d probably suggest eating someplace else . food is good but in my experience their beer makes the meal . i ve eaten here about half a dozen times during the past few years when in town for business weekends . it is centrally located on the corner of mill and fifth street in downtown tempe , amongst quite a few other local restaurants . during my most recent visit i ordered a steak at lunch along with one of the seasonal brewed beers . steak was okay but i wouldn t order it again . beer was exceptional , so i wasn t unhappy overall . i love burgers and i think i ll stick to that as my primary choice when eating here in the future . i can t think of any times when service was particularly unsatisfactory , nor were there times when service really stood out as exceptional . i have almost always eaten here on a saturday afternoon , and it s typically been fairly busy during the lunch hour . never had a problem getting a table , which is important since i m usually heading back for an afternoon conference session . i love the big glass beer mugs not sure what size they are but i can t always down the whole thing during a short lunch break i m a lightweight . overall , good place to eat if you re hungry and in the downtown area , but i wouldn t go out of my way to get here .

0,"this place used to be amazing . my favorite memories of past years is going to this seafood place with my parents . it s not the same anymore . we went for my wife s th birthday . my dad decided to join us . my wife ordered steak and shrimp , my dad ordered steak , i ordered a crab stuffed lobster . i have had the crab stuffed lobster many times before . i was craving it . we got our appetizer s . dad got snails , wife and i shared steamers . my dad was happy with the snails . but then again , how can you go wrong with snails doused in garlic and butter ? the steamers were steamed little neck clams in a garlic broth . it was not long neck clams like the rest of the world calls steamers . i wasn t about to argue with the server that these are the wrong clams . the food came and for the first time in my life i was asking the server to take back my meal before i even tried it . it looked dry and over cooked . i told the server i ve had this dish many times before and this is not the way it s supposed to be . he told me this is what it s supposed to look like and begged me to try it . i took one bite and i couldn t even swallow it because it was so dry . of course the server was gone by this point and didn t come back for minutes to ask me how it was . while i was waiting for the server to return , i told my family i was just going to get the steak . they just shook their head and told me not to . i took one bite of my dad s steak and spat it out . how do you screw up steak this bad ? it tasted like beef jerky and butter . my dad and wife would have complained too , but it s my wife s birthday and i am already stealing her thunder . i swapped my meal out for a steamed lobster . how do you screw up a steamed lobster ? fortunately , that came out fine . so we left hungry and poorer . i used to not mind paying the money they charged but now , it is not worth it . i am really hoping people stop coming here so they can just close down .

1,"wow , i am surprised at the last review . i have found the food at bada boom pasta room to be excellent every time i have been there . i am in love with mr . pink s pasta . it has a delightful vodka sauce , and you can also add proscuitto wrapped shrimp as well . they have a fantastic martini selection a well , and the decor it hip and fun . did anyone say red velvet walls ? great place !

0,"i know . . . i know . . . it s phoenix but i expected something far better . perhaps my mistake . located in what looks like an old fast food location this is a no frills , no cart , and no nonsense dim sum experience . don t think i will be going back for many reasons but if you are craving some bao or need a dumpling fix this place will do . . . just dont expect much .

1,"beaver choice is an excellent place which i have had the chance to visit three or four times . this is about as home cooked as you can get in a restaurant . it s like eating at mom s house , if mom happens to be swedish . i ve had a few of the entrees schnitzel cordon bleu , pork medallions , seared gravlax and all were delicious . especially the gravlax . the sides are also great , and you usually get three per meal . the poutine is perhaps not as good as what you d get in quebec , but it s easily the best i ve had in arizona . the fact that they even have poutine wins this place a few points . i have also had the opportunity to try their dessert specialty , the beaver supreme . this mess of chocolate , meringue , cream , mandarin orange , and possibly a few other things , is the sort of thing which you set out intending to only eat half in the first sitting , but ultimately find your free will diminished , invariably resulting in an empty dish and a fear of the onset of diabetes . also , it seems one gentleman gave this place low marks for the long preparation time on a chicken wrap . i just have to ask , why would anyone go to a scandinavian restaurant and order a chicken wrap ? can you imagine what would happen if you wander into a viking camp and order a chicken wrap ? your head would be off before you could recite one measly odinian incantation .

1,"i love lolo s chicken and waffles and you will too ! recently my fianc and i went to lolo s . i had heard about lolo s and mrs . white s for years , but never took the time to go to the phoenix locations . when this south scottsdale location opened , i made it a point to go and try the food . the food is excellent or in my best brooklyn accent forget about it . but don t forget about it , the mac n cheese is a most try . the chicken is fantabulous , the collard greens are on point and they serve kool aid . yes i said kool aid . i must have had a gallon of grape kool aid . before this , the last time i had kool aid was . this place is very popular , so you may have to wait for a table , but it is well worth it . this place is so popular that sports , music , acting and reality celebrities can be seen here regularly . when we were there we saw the rapper biz markie . he did the song just a friend back in . the only down side although the service was generally good , it gets so busy that at times the server may get distracted and may not come back to you as timely or often as you may like . bottom line , i left full , happy and with a kool aid smile . try it you will like it"

1,"i m working downtown now new themed list to come soon ! so i m exploring the area from a different angle . i m no stranger to downtown midtown s happy hour and dinner spots , but i ve never had to go out and search for breakfast or lunch during the day . i checked out focaccia one morning when i hadn t had breakfast yet at the recommendation of my husband , myles m , who works right around the corner . he said i should order the breakfast burrito , so i did , because he s pushy and i always do what i m told . ok , neither of things are true , but in this case , he had conviction and i obediently complied . the breakfast burrito was worth every penny . being a somewhat recent convert to pescetarianism , i got it with egg whites cool that they had that option , spinach , green salsa and potatoes . the woman behind the counter made it up right there on the grill and it was warm and delicious . the potatoes were skin on which gave them a great texture and flavor . the eggs were perfectly cooked and the green salsa had a great kick . the hot coffee from the carafe i got to accompany it was airplane quality , but next time , i ll just grab something from cartel on the way back to my office . god knows the burrito alone will be enough to keep me coming back to focaccia .

0,we bought or second jura compressa coffee machine from sur la table . it was an expensive model priced over k . after . short months it stopped working . the only option they offered was to send it in for repair . when i asked to have it replaced i was told the turn around was hours . its actually weeks when all is said and done . i high priced item and thats the kind of customer service . not to mention an expensive product that cant make it days . extremely bad customer service on this one . 
1,"this was definitely the best meal of this year s holiday trip . . . . the kale caesar ! is a very creative interpretation of the timeless classic . we loved the melted scamorza cheese . i had the applewood smoked duck for my entree , accompanied by a glass of the siduri pinot from willamette . the wine was perfect with the cherry sauce , besides the fact that pinot is a classic pairing with duck . a glass of siduri for is a great deal , too . i loved the way the duck was prepared , too , and it did not weigh me down afterwards like duck often can , either . my wife had the buttermilk roasted chicken along with a glass of their creative and delicious interpretation of sangria . roasted brussels sprouts and sweet corn are part of the presentation . dessert was the decadent dream pudding jar . we always get excited about an original dessert dish , and this one did not disappoint . service was top notch all the way , also .

1,"okay , talk about coincidences . . . . the other day i was compli chatting with fellow yelper jarvis about hard to find music . today i run into a past acquaintence while out and about . how do either of these tie into a review of boom boom la rue s ? okay , follow along if you will . so i run into this past acquaintence who s apparently had a bit of a rough week . she tells me about finding this store in the middle of a bad day and it immediately turned her frown upside down . she s raving about it . then she tells me she has a yelp account and has added a review . i tell her i too have some reviews on yelp . today i m in that neck of the woods and so i stop in . holy hell ! this place is a drag queen s delight ! it s insanely glitterific and there are beaded dresses and sequined accessories everywhere . not anything i can personally do anything with , but i did manage to pick up a few things as gifts for friends . and none of it broke the bank . what does this have to do with my convo with jarvis ? a day or so ago we were discussing hard to find music and i brought up nina hagen . the sales girl in this store was a dead ringer for nina hagen ! ! ! ! flame red spikey hair and clothes right out of pure punk rock ! that took me back to the good old days for sure . she knew the stock , was able to make excellent suggestions by asking specific questions and wasn t the least bit pushy . she was able to attend to several customers at the same time and created a very social atmosphere for everyone there . for someplace i didn t expect to feel comfortable in , it was a pleasant surprise . while there wasn t anything there i would feel the need to buy for myself , i could see going back again and again to get gifts for friends . a great experience .

1,"tough to rank this place . . . it is a retirement community first off . the club house is awesome . pool is salt water and heated . courses are nice , little bit of a challenge but basically flat . the putt putt course is very challenging and really cool . i m not impressed at all with the club food and suggest staying away from the roast beef . it seemed fake .

1,"this place is very cool ! i went here after work with a sorority sister for drinks on a friday night . ended up staying for like . hours . fantastic atmosphere with outdoor and indoor seating . lighting is dim and intimate indoors with rustic seating areas and large booth perfect for groups getting drinks together . the outdoor patio is sectioned off in a covered area with tables and smaller seats while an uncovered area hosted seating for peeps who rode their bikes in . the drinks are pretty yummy . if you re into fruity , girly cocktails there isn t much to choose from , but for a more mature , grown u beverage , you re in luck . hit the happy hour which sadly ends at pm . it gets a tad loud and it difficult to tell the wait staff apart from the customers because they re all in street clothes but they re very attentive and sweet . we ordered the fondu plate and it was great . pretzels , sausage , apples and the cheese . . . perfect for sobering up a bit from those yummy cocktails .

1,"baiz market is a mediterranean type restaurant , or arabic type food . well , you could get confused and call it that . the fact of the matter is though , that this place has a very unique touch . this restaurant is a staple not only for groceries , but also its food . the owner is persian , so you can tell where the tastes are coming from . its somewhat hidden in the heart of phoenix , but that s ok , once you are there you will be glad you found it . this place is unique because they make their own bread ! are you kidding me ? i only recently found out about this place like years ago , and i ve been living in phoenix for years . the chicken and beef shawarma have a special , authentic taste because of the fresh bread . one of the best parts about the shawarma is not only its amazing taste , but the pricing is very fair as well . i don t think i can stress this enough , but the fresh bread just sets this place apart from all the impostors in the phoenix metro area . why haven t the other restaurants caught on ? i know of maybe one persian restaurant that makes their own bread , but their pricing makes them a different story i m talking about the persian room in scottsdale . i just don t understand how other restaurants can serve the bread that comes in plastic bags from a manufacturer hundreds of miles away . good bread and arabic bread are all good forms of pita that have great shelf life due to the ridiculous amounts of preservatives , but they just don t taste fresh . if you like the bread , head to the back of the store and there is a shelf of freshly baked pita bread , its baked throughout the day , i think . i can tell because sometimes my bread is still warm and the bag has a little condensation . beware though , the bread gets hard and crunchy after a few days , so you really need to use it quickly . this isn t bad , its just i think they choose not to add preservatives to ensure the freshness of the pita . i usually just get the chicken or beef shawarma , but i decided i d get a kabob plate one day because i also wanted hummus . the beef kabob plate came with hummus , bread , skewers of beef kabob , and some pickles and onions . wow . the beef kabobs were cooked perfectly , and were extremely tender . it was a tad bit on the lemony side , but i suppose that was necessary to make it so tender . perhaps some of the best persian kabobs i have ever had . the hummus was definitely good as well , i can t stand restaurants that crack open a can of premade hummus . this restaurant certainly did not disappoint with the hummus . i know friends in tucson that make stops specifically at this place for shawarma , and rightly so . if you re weary of persian food , just check this place out . its not expensive at all , food for two is like . the wide variety of ethnic foods is also interesting .

1,"let me begin by telling you about my horribly debilitating fear of going to the dentist . it s epic . weeks before an appointment i start having nightmares . thinking about sitting in the dental chair makes me break out in a cold sweat . i require nitris oxide for a simple cleaning . the sound of the drill is enough to make me want to claw my face off . basically , every visit has been the worst experience ever for the past years . . . . enter dr . marcia blazer . i read about her online when searching for a local dentist here in scottsdale . i literally googled dentists for anxious patients , and her name popped up . her website appeared too good to be true . they offered nitris plus , offered non invasive options for dental procedures double plus , and offered a staff used to accomodating those with a healthy dose of dental fear . i went in for my first visit a cleaning and exam , and i was amazed at how comfortable they made me feel . they were warm and friendly , and put me at ease immediately . during the cleaning , my least favorite part is always when they use the scrapy , pointy torture device to stab off all the plaque at the gumline . how happy was i when they used an air abrasion tool instead . . . felt like a cool stream of water on your teeth , and bam , they re clean ! they were so calming , that when i was informed that i had cavities , i didn t even have a panic attack at the thought of coming in . fast forward two weeks to my filling appointment . i had requested nitris hey , i was feeling better but still super anxious , which they had all set up in the room for me when i walked in . now here s my favorite part . as i sat in the chair , the assistant brought over two big boxes full of dvd s and asked me what movie i would like to watch during the procedure . . . what ? ? so i picked a lighthearted comedy first dates . i was then given noise eliminating headphones to use goodbye horrible drilling sound , nitris hello happy gas , and a few hand signals to recognize if i was supposed to open or close my mouth . and we were off ! she didn t try to maintain conversation soooo annoying when dentists do that , and before i knew it she was done and i was disappointed because my movie wasn t quite over ! i was even told that had my dentist not needed the room i was in for another patient , that i would have been welcome to stay and just finish the movie ! i have had several interactions with this office since then regarding billing and follow up , and every time it is a pleasure to deal with them . i highly recommend this office to anyone !

0,"i had a good bad experience while at cadillac ranch . the inside decor was pretty cool and had comfortable booths , which i appreciate . we ordered three different appetizers that were on happy hour before our entrees . the wontons , the queso dip , and the chicken tenders . the tenders were good . they were beer battered and tender . the queso dip was pretty bland and the chips awful . they weren t stale but just obviously super low quality . the wontons were obviously frozen and sitting on a bed of syrup . it was like having desert and appetizers at the same time . when it came time to order entrees i was the last to do so . i asked my server about an option between three entrees and she danced around all of them suggesting that i have a pulled pork sandwich that was clearly less expensive than the ribs , steak or taco plate i inquired about . i should have headed her advice . it isn t every day a server tries to under sale you i ordered the ribs and was disappointed . the texture was off the flavor was bland except for the sauce which was spicy and not good enough to mask the bad flavor . my server liz was awesome . she was attentive and friendly . she noticed i hadn t eaten my entree and took it away . the manager came back and was apologetic he offered me another entree and i took liz s advice and got the pulled pork sandwich . it was much better . the staff was good and did there job very well . it isn t their fault the food quality is so bad .

0,"my parents love pho so i ve practically been enjoying vietnamese cuisine since the womb . ha ! no wonder i love it so much myself that it was always on the weekly dinner rotation when i lived in oc . alas , i moved to north phoenix and i dont have little pho shops or boba cafes on every street corner . i ve learned that i have to drive a ways to chandler mesa to satisfy these cravings . imagine my surprise when the husband and i noticed tea lite cafe when we changed up our movie theater location this past weekend . of course , we had to try it out and we d been dying for some pho for months now . we both ordered the beef pho and took a seat . the place is small but there s plenty of seating and still feels spacious . the cashier up front was super friendly and welcoming which was nice . we didn t have to wait too long for our food to arrive . . . another plus . the pho itself has really tasty broth and the beef was nice and tender . i was disappointed by the small portion of bean sprouts , mint leaves and limes that accompanied the soup . i m used to overflowing plates of these veggies so i can load up my soup to my heart s desire . in fact , my hubby usually counts on me doing this since i end up eating all my veggies and leaving most of the beef for him . double ha ! but the lack of sprouts and mint leaves didn t put a damper on the great taste of the pho . what i did miss was the traditional pho ingredients like tripe , rare steak and tendons . i know , i know . . . sounds intense but trust me it makes pho taste soooo good . i guess i just have a usual when it comes to pho so i was a little disappointed when i couldn t satisfy my craving to the utmost degree . woe is me . but let me conclude by stating again that the pho here is really good and has a great flavor to the broth . i think the hubby and i will go back since it is so conveniently located to us . it ll definitely do in a pinch although i am sure i will occasionally find myself making the trek to get me some tripe !

0,"i ve returned to this place more times after my last review . wait service was still inconsistent , especially with the dimwitted waitress . the restaurant was plagued with out of foods often . a few months ago , the dimwitted waitress didn t tell us the appetizer was out till the end when i initiated the inquiry . apparently she has already removed the out item from our bill . the wait service for my last meal with a group of friends was better at pm on a saturday . we ve got service from different wait staffs . they were serving everybody else too . not just us . the food came out fast and the taste was right on this time . they were out of egg plant . we didn t tell them that ranch supermarket was doors down . so diners , i still consider this place a good choice for authentic foods . i will give . stars this time .

1,"i must hand it to them at olive and ivy ! first rate atmosphere and food . the pesto is the most flavorful i have ever had and that includes pesto i have eaten in italy . wine selection is terrific . the breakfast , lunch and dinners are wonderful . the bar feels a bit like a meat market but that is the only down side . it is beautiful , clean and worth returning to again and again .

1,"i get a call on thursday dude , i just got fired from uop , we have to celebrate ! if it was from anyone else but ryan , i would have been shocked . however , he hated his job and we love yard house , so i was definitely down to have some fu uop drinks up at desert ridge . yard house has been one of our main spots for years . right off the bat , the happy hour is fantastic beers on tap , including some of az s finest and a couple amazing international brews . the servers usually do a great job of suggesting drinks as well . traditionally i cleanse the palate with a warsteiner pilsner and roll from there . friday night , i tipped back a few kiltlifters as well , all brought in well frosted pint glasses . the food has been pretty fantastic across the board . personally , you can t go wrong with firecracker wings sweet and very spicy wings and the spinach dip . their seared ahi appetizer and caesar salad are both fantastic , with the ahi always perfectly cooked . the southern fried chicken breast is likely the best meal , though my pal is a huge fan of the cuban dip . the one potential drawback is the service isn t always fast . honestly , if you are going to relax and enjoy time with your friends , it s great . beer glasses don t stay empty too long , waters get refilled we only sit on the patio , and the food usually comes out before you get too hungry . just understand that the joint gets busy for happy hour and you will enjoy the experience . give me a call if you ever want to share some fu beers !

1,"this was my first experience with lush with many more to follow . i stumbled into the store because i could smell it stores down , and i was drawn in by the aroma i don t even thing i read the name on the sign . . . i just followed my nose . i had never seen anything like it ! the giant blocks of soap , the colorful bath bombs , the bubble bars that looked like little cakes , and so much more ! it was late december , so the sales staff told me that any left over christmas items were buy get free what a deal on my first visit ! . they demonstrated a bath bomb for me , and i was mesmerized ! i got christmas bath bombs of them for free ! and travel sized snow fairy shower gels another christmas product , and by far one of my favorite lush products ever . i also got some non holiday bath bombs and melts because they were just too heavenly to pass up i got a youki hi bath bomb , my favorite bath bomb ever , which was sadly discontinued sometime last year . i also got my first piece of lush soap sexy peel . all the citrus just makes me smile when i use this soap . it s sunshine in your shower since i used to work in the mall i would go into lush whenever i had a break and get a couple things , and the staff always recognized me they even offered me a hand cream sample one day when i was complaining of dry hands . i brought some of my friends from school in and told the girl behind the counter that they were newbies , so she rushed out from behind the counter to demonstrate everything in the store ! literally , she showed us bath bombs , bubble bars , face cleansers and toners , massage bars , and dusting powders . i was so impressed by her powder demo that i bought some candy fluff dusting powder another item that has since been discontinued . vanilla puff powder is a nice substitute . this store holds a special place in my heart because it was the first lush store i ever went to , and i will forever have fond memories of the staff that dazzled me , and every time i smell sexy peel soap or snowfairy shower gel i am reminded of that magical day "
0,like many car washes they do what it takes to scrape by . i am still looking for a place that actually puts a little extra elbow grease into it . i am tired of being upsold on exterior waxes etc and they cant even take the time to vacuum my seats . 
1,confirmed better than subway blimpie quiznos etc etc not really much else to say that hasnt been said above . wished they had more vegetarian options 
1,"i absolutely love the food here ! the sushi and walnut shrimp are cravings that i must give in to . this is a nice , small restaurant that is exceptionally clean and comfortable . good for a casual date , lunch any day their specials are a great deal , and the owner managers are on site most hours they are open . you have to try the walnut shrimp !

1,went and got some delicious boba today . mango and strawberry banana . guy behind the counter is very welcoming and friendly . my choice place for quick to go boba . 
0,"went to this place for the first time the other night . . biggest plus for the place is that it has its own parking with some one checking to make sure you are there for the restaurant , the one thing i hate about downtown is parking . on to the food , a basic dinner of pork fried rice , chicken chow mien , and kung pao chicken . . . it was okay . the pork fried rice was basic and the chow mien was too slimy . the kung pao chicken was alright , kind of disappointed in its lack of sauce but the veggies and almonds that came where good . pretty much , this place is good for quick and cheap food . the staff was helpful and kind and the restaurant had a cute downtown vibe to it with a random birdcage in the middle . overall i would try it again , but will try something different on the menu .

0,"i ve been here twice , which was obviously enough . the first time was in , before i was old enough to drink legally . it became obvious to me then that state fairs are only fun for people over or under . in , i came with some friends who bought a hamburger at one of the tents , took one bite , and threw it in the trash . one of them remarked later that it was the only time in his life he d spit food out in disgust . while this was happening , another friend and i asked a toothless vietnam veteran manning another tent where we could find the nearest restroom . his reaction suggested that we were insane for asking such a ridiculous question we surmised that perhaps , due to some bizarre war injury , he had not taken a piss since . bottom line , customer service is not high on the priority list at the state fair . nor is edible food .

1,"i love , love , love the keg ! i ve been to this location as well as san tan village , tempe marketplace and desert ridge and have had nothing but exceptional food and service . i really like the atmosphere , it has that dark , cozy steakhouse feeling without being too stuffy or pretentious . we enjoyed an excellent halloween dinner here last night which included a keg sized glass of fetzer chardonnay , a margarita very strong , the keg classic dinner ceasar salad , oz filet wrapped in bacon , mixed vegetables and a loaded baked potato , bacon wrapped scallops an appetizer that i ordered for my entree and their fabulous bread with whipped butter , yum ! our server was very outgoing and friendly and offered suggestions as far as the menu . the bill with tax and tip was , really an excellent value . overall , a great meal and dining experience . i will definitely be back and can t wait !

1,"with a name like the lodge , i thought i was going to an old dirty restaurant with some of the neighborhood locals . we went here after a soccer game two weeks ago , and i have to say , i thought i was going to be disappointed . i expected greasy food , and grimy scenery . this was not the case , although the scenery was mildly disturbing as most of the decor included some dearly departed wildlife . i had a great sandwich i believe called the healthy choice , that was supposedly was healthy ? it came on this great thick toasted buttery whole grain bread , egg whites , hollindase sauce , tomato and avocado . it was one of the best sandwiches i have ever had . i don t think it was a calorie saver by any means but i am sure it was just the idea it was made with healthier ingredients . for a lodge , this was a terrific restaurant , and yes this is a compliment by far , joking aside , as you remember my thoughts of what a lodge was all about . this is nothing like the local vfw . the only other scary part was this jerk at the bar decided to take his shirt off , and throw it across the room . and ladies , no , this was definitely not a pretty sight nor was it funny . they need to enforce the shirt and shoes required law here otherwise it will earn a lodgey reputation from me . luckily , as this ghastly sight appeared , we quickly disappeared on our way home .

1,"one of my favorite boutiques in scottsdale , i can always find something i don t need but have to have at elan . lisa and her entire staff are friendly , helpful , and always have great suggestions . they keep the inventory fresh and edgy . some of the pieces i ve gotten there never fail to get compliments . it can be a little pricy , but everything i ve gotten there is well made and things i ll wear again and again so . . . lisa puts on some great events and really engages with her customers .

0,"went around lunch today and got a blended double chocolate mocha . the staff were really nice and the building is really cool , but my coffee was more of a milk shake than any sort of blended coffee i even asked to make sure it was made with coffee . it had no coffee flavour at all and certainly wasn t double chocolate . i loved all their different seating , the vintage cash register and even one of the coolest bathrooms i ve ever been in , but if i m going to pay nearly for a oz drink , i want it to taste amazing . was also disappointed that they didn t have any real selection in the bakery case it was all sandwiches , breads , and a tarte which looked good but was also overpriced . they apparently won some prizes for best cupcake or something and there were no cupcakes in the case when i went in .

1,"this location opened up just weeks ago , and offers high quality , natural products for mainly cats and dogs , although there is a very basic small animal section . the emphasis is on foods that are more nutritious , healthier , and that don t have corn or soy in them . there is a large freezer section in the back with a good selection of raw food meals . also , there is a plethora of treats and toys for your furry friend as well . the small animal foods section has a few small bags of hay , some treats , pellets , and toys . i wasn t too impressed with their rabbit selection , and they did not offer high quality brands such as oxbow which is a bit surprising since they have so many high quality dog and cat products . jill , the manager , was very enthusiastic and is very passionate about providing the best products for pets . she showed me various treats , foods , and toys , and provided a lot of educational material on dog nutrition and health . she provided a free sample of some nice grain free dry dog kibble which is highly recommended on dogfoodadvisor . com , which i appreciated a lot since my dog is a bit picky with the food he eats . this is definitely a place to go to spoil and pamper your dog or cat !

1,"chick has the potential to be a restaurant we want to keep coming back to . the food will keep us trying for an exceptional experience , but some things needs to be fixed if chick is to see it s first anniversary . . the space cute slightly upper scale boutique farmhouse . decor and lighting is warm yet modern . the only miss the beautiful tables . they are heavily distressed with very deep grooves as if made from reclaimed wood . there can t possibly be any way for them to clean the tables thoroughly the thought of a small portion of everyone s food that has dined here before me staring at me especially as time goes on and those grooves fill up with food germs grosses me out . a piece of glass on each table is a definite food safety must . to make matters worse , tables are set with your silverware on the bare table . silverware should never be placed on anything other than a fresh a napkin or table cloth . . the menu the menu they offer is a little different from your average restaurant which can make for a memorable experience . however , putting a menu like theirs in a small but thick leather bound binder with just a couple items per page made us feel like unwelcome outsiders . the incessant flipping between pages with types of entrees and sides and sauces was quite frustrating . i recommend picking up the takeout menu at the front door and using that to navigate the menu . . the service awkward but very friendly . our waiter seemed like a foodie fit for a restaurant like this , but his table presence left us feeling like we needed to make him comfortable talking to us or requesting anything . i had to fight most of the meal to have more than ice cubes in my iced tea . after asking a couple members of the staff for a glass of ice , they kept bringing back my glass with just more tea and no more ice . at one point , the server brought my iced tea glass back without a straw . when i asked for one , his reply was can you use the one from your water glass for now ? . the food this is what made up for most of the other shortcomings especially because chick is still new . i had the country pork with creamed corn and mashed potato bar . you get toppings with the mashed potato which the chefs will assemble for you . i chose mesquite sour cream , applewood smoked bacon , and vermont white cheddar delicious ! the creamed corn was very tasty as well . the mandarin orange chutney paired amazingly well with the pork . my husband had the chicken and dumplings . it s a little different from the traditional c d , but was very good . it s served in a lighter broth instead of a heavy sauce which was a welcome change . we decided next time the hubby and i go , we would take our chances at the bar and avoid the servers until they can get caught up on their service skills .

1,"indian food is often minimized by attempts to make it less exact and somehow more palatable by other cultures . this is at the cost often of not allowing the original beauty of the cuisine to be savoured by all . in fact , my visit to the indian paradise was not without some sarcasm and pessimism on my part given that so many places in the area get it wrong when it comes to this genre . boy , was i wrong ! don t let the fascade of the place fool you . when you enter , it takes a few seconds to smell the fact that you are going to have the genuine article here . if you go at lunch time , you can experience the buffet . i went on a sunday afternoon and the place was perfectly poised for a sunset dining experience . all the food . . . from the nan to the lamb curry , to the tea , to the samosas to the califlower . . . . everything was really good . but i have to also add that there was a certain family like atmosphere created by the staff and the service was unassuming yet intuitive . i found that i did not want to leave . i just wanted to stay here and talk and snack a little . that s kind of hard to achieve in a strip mall restaurant yet , this did not feel like that . you should go for yourself and see if i was just way too nostalgic for good indian or whether its really worth stars .

1,"i went here for dinner since my friend said the the location in cave creek was one of her favorite mexican restaurants in the valley . however , living in phoenix and scottsdale , we decided to go to the fountain hills location . plus , another friend lives there so it was a more central location for all of us . we arrived around and it wasn t crowded at all , we got a table right away . we got chips and salsa to start which was perfect since i was really hungry with it being way past my dinner time . one of the girls got a pomegranate margarita and she said that it was really sweet but good . i got the fish tacos and they were delicious . probably the best fish taco i ve had . i was expecting some sort of fried fish , probably cod . i was pleasantly surprised that it was grilled and the two tacos came wrapped up in the foil pouch they were cooked in . it also had this really good sauce . the hard shell tacos that my friends got also looked really good . the shell looks homemade , fried , and super crispy . my friend asked for extra cheese which they brought out in a small dipping bowl . she was also charged extra for this . the tacos didn t come with that much cheese to begin with , so that s kind of a rip off . the price isn t that cheap either , i would definitely say it s on the pricey side . the atmosphere was just okay . i was reading how it s the most romantic location , etc . but maybe they re just referring to the cave creek location . all of the employees were nice and even took a group photo of us at the end since my friends were visiting from all over . i definitely want to go to the cave creek location in the future to see what all the fuss is about , but it ll definitely be more of a special occasion thing since it s definitely a hike from scottsdale . in the mean time , i ll stick to my other local favorites for tacos .

0,"this seems like a decent place to get a drink , if youre so inclined , before going thru security . the service was so so , but i also think our waiter was in training . we didnt venture very far into the actual restaurant , just sat at one of the pub tables by the enterance to keep an eye on the security line , so i guess its good for that as well .

1,"cozy , cute and yes , a little claustraphobic . . . coronado cafe . perhaps the latter adjective is my own issue , but at foot inches i felt really tall . an adorable little home , with creaky wooden floors transformed into a comfortable cafe with approachable american fare . after navigating the dicey , sandy , lumpy parking lot i accidentally entered the kitchen door . my bad . i was redirected to another door and entered through the rear . yikes did i just say i entered through the rear ? anyway a lovely staff person told me to go to the front and check in . meandering through the cafe i really did find it lovely . very neat , old yet modern and strangely very loud . it was a booming lunch crowd on a monday . taking mom and dad out for a mother s day lunch . we waited a few minutes for a table and were constantly being said hello to and asked if we ve been helped by a friendly , friendly staff . shout out to the staff ! the menu , while not especially inventive , seemed fresh and yummy . the soup of the day was a tortilla soup with its own stamp on it . no tortilla strips atop the cup , yet and especially flavorful soup , creamy with a twinge of tanginess to it . mom and i both had the turkey sandwich with cranberrry sauce . huge mother of a sandwich . i always wonder about the big sandwich because you cannot possible bite into it without making a mess . not a strike against them , cuz it was very good , bread was fresh and turkey seemed unprocessed . dad ordered the ham and cheese , but stripped away all the interesting flavors , because , well , because he s a dad and likes the meat and potato type menu . dessert was a wonderful and decedent brownie with ice cream , chocolate and caramel sauces . very good . brownie was more like a cake though . again , no complaint , cuz it was dee lish . service was so great i have to say . friendly , professional and fun . i like the idea of eating in an old house . the contrast of old phoenix with striking photography of modern new york strewn about the rooms was quite cool . i recommend a visit . i m craving the tortilla soup and would love to try other items on the menu . most importantly it was a wonderful way to hang with mom and dad who ventured in from sun city in their mini van , navigating the central ave . mess , god bless em and we truly had a good experience . coronado cafe . cute . cozy . comfortable . and in the end , not so claustraphobic .

1,"this was our last stop on the urban wine walk yesterday , and it was a great place to end the day . because this was our last stop , we were too late to get the wine special , however we decided to stay and grab a table on the gorgeous patio and get a full glass of wine . we also ordered some sweet potato fries to munch on . the patio was awesome and i love how the inside opened up to become an extension of the patio , or vice versa . we were lucky enough to be experiencing one of those perfect arizona days and i felt like i was sitting in a good friend s cute , cozy backyard . . . with table service . speaking of the service , no complaints from me ! the original plan was to get dinner , but the wine , fries , and good conversation were enough to fill us up and take us to the end of the night . i can t wait to go back soon , to enjoy the patio and try all of the delicious food i was reading about on the menu and now in everyones reviews !

1,"oh lawd ! ! ! so , i m a relative nevercomer to this cuisine . like most people , i hear szechuan and i think just spicy panda express food . meh . i couldn t have been more wrong . i was in atlanta with a friend , and he took me to a place that specialized in szechuan cuisine . i had my first experience with szechuan peppercorns there , and i was hooked . all i can say is , if you haven t already tried authentic szechuan cuisine , then you owe it to yourself to give this place a shot . and if you have , then you already know what i m tombout and you probably already eat here all the time any damned ways . enough other reviews have touted the wonders of that amazing spice , the szechuan peppercorn , so i ll let their words be the guiding lights of wisdom for that . what i m gonna tell you is i travel all over this great nation of ours , and this place delivers the goods , in the way that i want them . the food is inexpensive , it s reliable tasty , and it s exactly what it s supposed to be . other people have complained about the service , and to that , all i can say is get over it . it is what it is , and i haven t had any problems here . their food is exactly what it should be , it tastes exactly like it s supposed to , and i love it . still keeping an eye out for one of these asian girl white guy couples , though . . .

1,"i m not a vegan or a vegetarian , i thoroughly enjoy sinking my teeth into a thick juicy piece of medium rare steak . and i love eggs in the morning and chicken tacos at am . i am also very hesistant to try anything the attempts to substitute for meat , because i think it s just psychologically strange . but ever since my friend turned me onto green about years ago , i ve had nearly everything on the menu . and never been disappointed or grossed out by anything . my favorites number one absolutely has to be the mexi cali burger . i could eat these everyday . it has the flame broiled taste of a real burger and even the bright red color of raw meat , but don t let it freak you out . it also comes with hummus , bright orange nacho cheese , and chipotle sauce . this burger is spiiiccyyyy so beware . their fries are crispy and perfectly seasoned . also love their soy ice cream treats , soy namis , my favorite being the raisin with captain crunch . their lime ade , lemon ade , and teas are always fresh and delicious . i also love the diablo red bowl which is another dish for spicy lovers and comes with fresh roasted eggplant yummmm and tomatos . their pita chips and hummus are to die for . they re crispy chips which i enjoy better than just a regular pita being served with hummus . and their buffalo wings are almost as good as the real thing . green nails vegetarian and healthy mock ups of american food right on the head .

0,"i have been to this location several times because again , right around the corner from my salon . i so want to be able to give it a higher rating but every time i go the service is really not that great . last week i went for wing and wii night , cent wings cant be beat . i have had better wings , but hey this is a mexican joint and our bill was not even ! but our waitress looked like she could care less about being there , never asked if we wanted a refill on our chips and salsa and never stopped by the table to see if we like our food . now being in the service industry and having spent many years as a server i get that you think since the bill is so low your tip is going to suck . that simply doesn t have to be the case , we left our server a tip and we weren t even there long . you get tables like that an hour you are set , so perk up and smile , you never know how far that can go . i went there last night for taco tuesdays , to tacos can t be beat and the tacos are so tasty i always order , the mahi , crunchy fish and steak . the mahi was flaky and sweet , the crunchy taco had a sweet taste to it with the sauce and red onion . not greasy at all . the steak was tender and flavorful . again though our service was sub par . we had already finished our chips and salsa before we even got our water , took way to long , same with the food and it wasn t even that busy . we were sitting inside and there were only people in the bar area and there was only one other table eating . now our server wrote our order on her had , she seemed tired and frazzled , and we had to bring our bill to her at the end to check out , we waited a while before doing that . it seemed like she might have been the only server in the place , but she did have the help of a gentleman by the name of frenchy . i liked frenchy , big dude but with dry wit and he seemed like the jack of all trades for the place . doorman , food runner , busser , you name it he was doing it . i will continue to come to loco because the tacos are so damn good but i just hope they figure out the staff issues . i gave it times and every time my complaint is the same , the service needs to step it up .

0,i m sad to report that we dined here for lunch and it was inedible chef aaron please come by and monitor your staff . we had the eggplant sandwich and is was a disaster . it was so overly oily and the bun and fries overwhelmed the plate . the shrimp and grits were so average with the shrimp being of low quality . the beer menu looked fabulous . so i guess if this is just a watering hole things will be fine . . . but if you choose to dine be prepared to leave hungry and unsatisfied . we hope this turns around . the decor is cool and the staff is really fun and helpful . . . and we are hopeful for a great place to visit in the hood . 
1,"okay , so a group of us go out practically every friday to the same old places for beer and food , but mostly for beer . so to break out of the norm , i was in search of a place with excellent beer and good food and somewhat close to home . so onto yelp i go and came upon boulders , and the reviews were pretty good and definitely worth checking out . so we all pack into the car and head over to boulders . the parking is great , plenty of spaces to go around . you walk through the patio , not bad with all the misters , felt like i was in a rainforest , but very refreshing . so you walk a little further , watch the steps , and there s your bar . very open , plenty of hightop tables and lots of tv s . the beer menu was plentiful . it should make everyone from the microbrewer to the coors drinker happy . i was pleased because they had plenty of vegetarian meals , or dishes you can substitute meat for veggies . . . and for you meat eaters out there , i was told the burgers were delicious and the waffle fries were soooo tasty . the staff was helpful and attentive as well . i would definitely add this into our friday night rotation . if you re looking for microbrews , this is a place to check out . the atmostphere is kicking and just an all around good place to kick back .

1,"went to sticklers for the first time today , with a friend who works across the street . i m a little leary of places that get talked up so much , but sticklers was everything she talked about and more . a family friend once told me that the way to tell a good restaurant is how busy it is . seems like common sense now , but how many times have you walked into a restaurant with less than people in the whole place and then walked away disappointed ? well sticklers was packed . my first impression was crap , the line is people deep and we only have minutes for lunch . . . there s no way ! well i was pleasantly surprised when we got through the entire line , food in hand , in about ! the guys and gals that work there are efficient and have it down . and they showed some great patience for a newbie . the chicken salad and provolone sandwich was outstanding and the hot peppers gave it a great kick . word of warning to the lactose intolerant it s a piller ! the atmosphere was active and lively but not overly loud . we were still able to have a conversation without shouting . i just wished the people at the next table realized that . we didn t need to hear about their daughter wrongly accused of dui . . . for the third time !

1,"please give this place a try when you re making your next stop at pita jungle . this restaurant seems to be very underrated and overlooked . we went on a wednesday night around pm and it was empty while pita jungle was packed . just the two of us on the patio , which was very nice . the interior and atmosphere are great . nice tables chairs , candles , shelves with wine bottles and art , and a very nice bar . an iranian family owns the restaurant and cooks everything themselves . that s the first sign of a high quality establishment . they were incredibly nice to us and brought us whatever we needed . they gave us some good suggestions , like their iced black tea , which is fantastic . it has a few other elements to it including lavender . they brought us extra pita when we ordered some appetizers as well without us even asking . for our appetizers , we tried the hummus and the tabooli . the hummus was very creamy but a little plain . we wished there was more flavor or spice to it . not a big deal . that was the only part of our meal that was not stars , but stars . the tabooli . . . . ridiculous . i ve never been a fan of tabooli . it usually has too much parsley . but their version was balanced perfectly . for an entree , i tried the chicken shawarma and we split a side of basmati rice with saffron . a huge plate of rice with great seasoning . the saffron and olive oil gave the fluffy rice great texture . the shawarma was fresh and delicious . the chicken was cooked and seasoned nicely . for dessert , we tried the persian vanilla ice cream with rose water and saffron as well as the baghlava . the ice cream was some of the best we ve had . great flavor . the baghlava was a great complement to the ice cream . a nice sweetness from the honey and the flaky dough was great . so in summary , great atmosphere , great owners , out of this world food , and very affordable . everything we had came to about . we will return many times in the future because their menu is very promising . just wish their name fit the type of place that it is . the current name makes it sound like just another middle eastern restaurant , which it definitely is not .

1,"habaneros is an awesome little gem stuck in the strip mall hell known as scottsdale . if you are one looking for an original meal at a decent price , try out habaneros . i am addicted to their chipotle sauce . you can find it in almost every item there . try out the shrimp or fish tacos , they are delicious . sometimes the food takes a little while to cook and there could be a line . so be prepared if you are going there on your lunch break . the salsa is not as spicy as i would like , but i am splitting hairs at this point . go try habaneros , you wont be disappointed . its a nice change from every unoriginal , corporate restaurant you find in scottsdale .

1,"i went to this place with a family member upon their recommendation . the salad was amazing ! i forget exactly what it is called cowboy chopped salad i think ? . firstly it s gorgeous comes in rows of the ingredients which are beautiful colors arugula , tomatoes , pepitas , dried currents , chicken , asiago cheese , and dried corn for some crunch then when it gets to your table they pour on the dress a creamy dressing with a slight basil taste to it , and it all gets mixed together . i believe it usually comes with salmon instead of chicken but we ordered ours with chicken and it was a great fit , i highly suggest it . the rest of the menu looked amazing too , but i m not sure i could go there and not get the salad . so i suggest going with multiple people , splitting the salad and then splitting another entree . the decor of the place could probably use a little sprucing up and it s a bit on the cheesy side . service wise was unfortunately not the greatest experience . it was a slow time and we had a hard time getting our bill or being asked if we needed anything else . thus the deduction of a star . but i would still give it another try just for the food .

1,"inside the clarendon hotel in central phoenix , gallo blanco has quickly made a hit for themselves with hipsters and urban dwellers alike . they offer a refreshing alternative for hotel restaurants , with lively ambiance and great food and drink . gallo blanco s tacos are surefire hits . they re served individually , and come lined up in an appealing silver taco stand . we ve ordered the carne asada and shrimp soft tacos , and , wow , they re really mouthwatering . the shrimp is flame grilled and seared , bringing out a nice full flavor . the guacamole is slightly sweet and chunky , and paired with outstanding tortilla chips , this is a must order appetizer . even the sauces i prefer the red chipotle one are addictive , either to accompany the supreme tacos , or to be enjoyed alone on chips . this restaurant is a fine addition to the emerging downtown phoenix foodie scene , and with prices extremely reasonable , you get a lot . a good sized meal for two sans drinks could ring up at , which is a good value for great food . try gallo blanco , bring friends , and get a bunch of items . although i haven t explored the rest of the menu , i sense that gallo blanco s items don t stray far from excellence .

1,"used a groupon here , and it was a great experience ! the express mani pedi wasn t express at all they took their time with me , and everything felt great ! the woman who did my pedicure was fantastic . my toes and feet look wonderful ! the woman who did my manicure was pretty good . the only issue is that she accidentally cut my thumb . when it bled a little , she just painted over it . it s now been a few days , and my thumb still hurts . overall , it was a good experience though , and the staff was very friendly ! i would return for sure .

1,"a relaxing place to have wine , and talk with the very knowledgable what is the difference between cab franc and carm n re , great service waitress came on time and performed pourings properly and sexy well at least the waitress staff . blue black diamond wine bar great for me and deliberate by the wine bar medium advanced wine patrons come on down . newbies stay away because you re not going to get educated . just dont tell anyone about the place during live music night . . . i continue to come back year after year when i am in phoenix because of the athmosphere and wine selection . very extensive wine selection bottles on file make you wonder where are they hiding it all in this cozy location . and now the critque waitstaff has a bit of the starbucks effect where they are act with an aire of being smarter than the patrons . they serve bistro and flatbread style food perhaps my choice was silly but it over salted my palatte to the point it started to strip the roof of my mouth . with such a wine list , a little more probing from the waitstaff to make the pairing work out would be helpful . if you re going to act smarter than the patron , be more intrusive in helping pair the menu . i am used to wine bars around the country and the prices are above average most likely caused by the scottsdale area effect . finally , bring your solid black going out to the club outfit seems to be the uniform of choice of this speakeasy like patrons . great dark athmo to take and sauce liberally your date . give it a shot .

0,"summary not impressed . arrived early afternoon , ironically maybe that was the problem there wasn t enough going on , place was dead . i would have hoped that a restaurant manager would realize that the few customers they may have at a slow time are just as important as those on a friday night rush standards are standards , you either have them or you don t . waitress was pleasant but not attentive with a total of occupied tables had to get up and get her attention for more chips . chips though were very good needed hotter salsa . my friend had the steak fajitas tasted ok but just luke warm . fajitas are supposed to be sizzling hot duh . i had a so so tamale and chicken enchilada . enchilada was just warm , mostly a flat layer of cheese . tamale filling was tasty shredded meat as it should be but corn meal was barely warm and almost tasted only partially cooked . refried beans weren t warm enough to even melt the grated cheese sprinkled on top , which consequently then pulled off in a single congealed mass when i took a bite . finally , the cadillac margaritas were just average at best . plus tip for two meals plus two margaritas not worth it . the place looked promising and has a cute patio area but we won t be back someone s not watching the store . i m trying to be generous with the two stars as some other yelpers seem to like this place maybe things can get better .

1,"we went to christopher s with the deal chicken course dinner . the food was very good and the service was just as good . the lobster bisque was a bit too thin for my taste and is something i would pass on in the future . the lamb was delicious and the tuna salad was tasty as well . we opted to order dessert and the mousse tower was delicious . we were saddened that they did not have the grand marnier souffle on the night we went , which was highly recommended . will return !

0,"as i write this , i m waiting for the toilet in the room above me to stop refilling , and the man to the upper left of me to stop his muffled , out of key singing . that puts me in a weird head space , review wise . while this hotel is only three years old , it sounds like it may as well have been built in the s . i hear all the conversations of the folks in the hallway , i hear people walking down the hallway above mine , and for the past two days , the heavy footsteps of the person above me woke me up well before my alarm . normally i m pretty lenient about things like that but , c mon . this is a roadside haven meant for business travelers and tourists too stupid to see that this hotel is near nothing you re trying to visit arizona for to get some damned shut eye . it s a little tough under the current conditions . aside from , you know , sleeping . the rest of this courtyard is pretty nice . the interior and amenities vastly make up for the absolute desolation outside . it s located off st , just north of the freeway . there s a little patch of desert and an itt technical institute across the parking lot that seems too small to handle the amount of folks who need to park . anyway , back to the inside . this is a newer courtyard . marriott is drastically trying to get its old chains into a modernization fit to compete with hilton and hyatt s business lines . this renovation , or new construction in this case includes adding a restaurant for breakfast and dinner . and a bar across the way open from pm pm . thank god for these two additions because the pickin s around the hotel are slim as a calvin klein model . i think there s a chipotle around the corner . i didn t see you jump for joy . what , not impressed ? the rooms are the modern courtyard style with lg flat screens , fancy shampoos , interesting art on the walls , wired and wireless internet . . . etc . this location has low tile showers with glass doors . fancy . i m used to the sliding curtain that ends up soaking the floor because it s all cloth anyway . if they could get the sound issues fixed lucky me , i m on the side of the hotel not facing the freeway i d easily give another star . proximity to anything worthwhile is pretty bad , but the point of this hotel appears to be for housing workers in the local warehouses nearby . there s plenty of regulars here week after week after week as the bartender told me a few nights ago . one definite draw is that their weight room is pretty top notch and , of course , dead . you can easily be the only one in there night after night while folks who really need to use a gym will walk by you with minds set on beers , staring into the window as if to ask why anyone would try to work off the food they eat . hmmm . . . i wonder . the interior of this courtyard vastly makes up for the desolation"
1,"we stayed at the sheraton downtown and matt s was a short walk . definitely worth the walk , and it helped to justify eating such a large breakfast . there is probably something there that is not very good , but we did not find it . when you get there , make sure you check in with the person running the register"
0,"some friends came in so a group of of us went here . cool little place with good atmosphere , basic and cozy . wines by the glass were good . the bread was a bit stale but still pretty decent . we ordered a variety of things . the antipasto plate was good with several typical items . my tomato sausage pizza was good , not great . needs some spice and flavor . the halibut over sundried tomato basil risotto with aspargus was very good but the halibut was a little over cooked . otherwise , most everybody liked the food . one person ordered a dish and asked for a little spice but it was way too spicy and they basically couldn t eat it . her husband ate it the next day because he could handle the spice but seriously it was way too spicy for most people . not a bad place , would probably go back but won t drive out of the way as the location is a little out there .

1,"cesar chavez park is the best that the sw valley has to offer ! located at th ave baseline at the base of south mountain , it s a great location for the residents of south phoenix and laveen . i ve seen it very busy , but it also seems to be one of the best kept secrets in sw phoenix ! there is ample seating throughout the park , including ramadas and benches . a . mile trail wraps around the lakes in the center of the park , making it perfect for runners and walkers . there is a small tot lot and playground on the east side of the park that families will enjoy . no matter what time of day you visit the park , you will find people around the lakes fishing . be careful a friend once tripped on a fishing line that a careless fisherman didn t remove from the sidewalk and broke his elbow ! drawbacks this park is always dirty , as no one seems to clean up their trash after visiting and it is not safe in early morning or evening hours . otherwise , enjoy one of the better city parks !

0,"dropping down to three stars . . . on a recent visit , i saw two roaches on the main floor of the restaurant . no one seemed to care , so i got up and stepped on one . i pointed out the other , and one of the staff killed it , but they didn t seem surprised . i know that roaches are hard to control , but having two of them wandering about in a busy restaurant just isn t a good thing . also , our waiter was an overly chatty guy who seems to think we are interested in his voice . they had some good staff in the past , but i suspect the owner , who likes to get drunk and hang out on the patio , gives me the impression of a guy who would be difficult to work for ! the food is still decent and better than anything else i ve found , but i m looking for alternatives . . .

1,beautiful country setting in phoenix on an old farm . watch closely because it is easy to miss as it is actually an old farm near the legacy golf resort at south mountain . very good home made breakfast with fresh ingredients from the farm . orange juice was fresh and tasty . eggs and bacon were very good . biscuits and gravy were excellent . the setting was the star of this breakfast ! i would recommend ! you won t be sorry ! 
0,"i really want to rate the place higher . i like what it s all about . instead of pulling the building down and rebuilding something in that space , it has been converted to a community space . i went to see one of their cult classics , and the staff was ok . it was completely amateur hour i guess that s ok for the type of movie , etc . the problem was this was a sold out movie , and the staff brought in folding chairs to sit on to watch that would have been ok before the movie started , but ithey did it one at a time making noise for the first minutes of the movie clanging , whispering , etc . then they kept getting up and down . they seating was pretty bad . low seats that reclined normally that s ok , but there s usually some spring to it . these had no support at all . halfway through my back was hurting and would have to readjust but there was no comfortable way to sit in the chairs .

1,"two times a year , you can meander down mill ave and the adjoining streets to look at an array of art for sale . everything from jewelry and pop art posters to handmade kitchen utensils , photography and abstract paintings . if you go both in spring and winter , you re likely to see a few of the same artists . for the most part , tempe arts festival does a great job of providing variety . plus , it s fun to wander and look at things you may not have seen before let alone expected to see at an arts festival . this isn t the most exciting of art festivals . there s really no live music , unless you count the occasional melodies of flutes you hear when you walk by the vendor selling his handmade wooden flutes . i ve been three times and enjoyed myself every time . i wasn t wowed . i never saw anything i couldn t live without . but , like i said , this is a fun event to mark on your calender for both spring and winter even if it happens to rain during the festival . i give last winter s and this spring s festivals both a star review , for the weather and company were great . it was my first year going , and i was happy to see that tempe offered the valley something that appealed to people who really do try and appreciate art . after all , it s a consumer type of event , geared toward bringing the community and artists together . i can appreciate that . i give this winter s festival a star review . the rain didn t phase me . i can deal with a few sprinkles . what bothered me was the mixing of asu and uofa fans , both groups beginning to gather down on mill ave for the football showdown . don t get me wrong , i love a good sporting event and understand team rivalry . i just thought it was unfortunate that the upcoming game and the fans excitement took over the relaxed , casual feel that the arts festival usually has you know , when you can walk down the street and look at art without running into an impromptu cheer section . you see , fans were screaming in the streets hollering insults to the other team and waving their school s colors high . once again , i understand the fun of that . i just didn t expect it to be all over the streets in the early afternoon . maybe i m naive , though . the fans were a definite distraction from the art festival . knowing what would happen when alcohol was mixed into the equation , my friend and i decided to bolt . lucky we did . seems like tempe can t handle a few rain droplets , for when we were walking back to the car , a street lamp post nearly fell on our heads . talk about a commotion . i d much rather attention be fixed on the art festival rather than any football game or falling lamp posts , no matter how dramatic both of those things can be . i s pose this echoes the old saying , there s a time and place for everything . word to the wise parking can be hard to find , or require you to shell out for a spot . if you can , park somewhere closeby that s free of charge and hoof it on foot .

1,"this place really hits the spot . it s everything a hamburger place should be and nothing it shouldn t . their burgers are good sized and delicious . i attribute their scrumptiousness to the bread in the buns , but their meat is phenomenal as well add some cheese and green chiles , and it s like a bunch of awesome ingredients decided to get together to take part in creating one of the best burgers in town with a little help from the grill . the fries are effing good too . the pitchers of beer are cheap and cold , and if you want to feed your inner hipster they also have bottles of pbr and cans of schlitz . not a lot to feast the eyes on the place has a real old school bar feel but the food compensates for what it may lack in elegance .

1,"sunridge canyon has been one of my very favorite courses since i first played it years ago . i have to admit i did work here for a two year span several years ago , but it was one of my favorites before , during , and since then . it s not as hyped as grayhawk , troon , and some other courses but it s just as great of a layout , if not better than some of the more popular high end courses in the valley definitely better than the overrated grayhawk . the course has the rare distinction of being very playable yet very challenging at the same time . you ll be toast if you don t hit it fairly straight on most holes , but you won t be punished for hitting it where you intended like some of the blind shot heavy courses i . e . we ko pa here in the valley . i ve shot in the s one day and in the s the next out there . besides the superb and scenic layout , i also like the simplicity of the overall complex . it s not at a big resort , there aren t multiple courses , and there is no grand clubhouse not that all those things are always bad . it s just the holes , pro shop , and a restaurant that serves up some pretty solid food . the staff is friendly and helpful , too . it s like a neighborhood course albeit a high end one . they have some great summer rates for locals this summer any day , any time for only . i recommend all valley golfers to enjoy that rate while it lasts . i played yesterday and the course was in good shape tee to green , and outstanding shape on the greens . it s been awhile since i ve seen greens roll this well on a course here in town . one last , but important , note it gets windy out here . as in , it gets windy every day . the course plays through a canyon and the winds are swirling all the time . an early morning tee time is best since it gives you your best chance to take on the uphill back nine without the wind gusting in your face .

1,"one of my fav sushi places in the valley . great place to take someone who has never tried sushi or still is unsure of what they like . great place to take someone who loves sushi but is indecisive . some of my favorites include the spicy shrimp crab roll , phoenix roll , and their squid salad . plus you can t beat the vegas roll . for pieces ? it s a steal ! definitely one of the more fun sushi places in the valley ! "
1,"it s just a terrific steakhouse . one of the most upscale , all around dining experiences in phoenix . it s expensive . very expensive . but probably worth it . figure for a couple . i had the double filet medallion with blue cheese melted and a wine demiglaze . absolutely outstanding , amazingly tasty meats . equal or better than morton s or ruth s chris or capitol grill that s on the menu for tomorrow night . smashed potatoes were very good but nothing to write home about . veggies were pretty good . started with the ceasar salary , with a big pile of anchovies . perhaps the best caesar i ve ever had . desert was the mouse cake . good , but not to die for . their happy hour is also an excellent value . come before six and drinks are half off , and they serve little mini steak sandwhiches , which are very good . hint if you have kids , go to happy hour and have a drink or two . cocktails are in the range happy hour price . cucumber cooler was quite nice for a cocktail . let the kids eat the sandwiches , and then head to the dining room for a couple of filets . the kids are pretty full , you are nicely primed for a great steak , and the complete lack of a kids menu doesn t matter . honestly , otherwise , there really aren t any good kids options . i know , it s not a great place for kids , even well behaved , but sometimes you want to celebrate a special occasion with family . it would be nice if they offered a mini filet for and under for like , or a burger and fries for for the kids . just a thought . anyway , great experience , great food . a really upscale , while linen , old style steakhouse kind of place to have prime beef . "
0,"this place isn t bad . the place is pretty big in size and i love that they have a drive thru . i like coming here on the weekends , especially when i need to study , particularly in the vault . some times they have live music , which can be good or bad , depending on if you re there to study or hang out . they have decent coffee , not the best , but not awful . and i d prefer to go here over starbucks any day . "
1,"i love f e . been shopping at the th street location since it opened there doors . this store works best for me since i live a very busy lifestyle . the pre packaged foods , fruits and veggies make life easier for me . for a small store they have a great variety of things to choose from . this is not a one stop shop to find everything , however they seem to always have the items that work best for me . they don t have as many safeway or fry s grocery deals , but they have discounted items regulary to choose from . there prices are slightly higher then trader joes for the amount of food . the store is always neat and clean . there is tons of help incase you have guestions . you can bag your own or there is someone there to help you .

0,"first off nothing gourmet going on here at all . its basically subway with free delivery and they have to deliver it for free or there is no way in hell you would bother with the place . it s cheap , generic , flavorless food . "
1,"i love stax . they introduced me to the world of quinoa . their quinoa black bean burger is sensational . i do the build your own burger and get garlic aioli and the house ketchup . i am a big fan of their sweet potato fries , as well . the service has always been great and the prices are reasonable . this is a good alternative to delux , if you are in downtown scottsdale . "
0,"agree with most posters about the setup left much to be desired . i was smart and arrived before p . m . so i could jump in early for some short and fast lines . my yr old son was with me , and he s a fairly picky eater , which was one reason i brought him so he could see that there are other foods he might like if he tried them . i got a lot of food between and , when the lines were short . i probably got to try trucks before we left at . we went back to some trucks more than twice or three times when we found something we liked . my advice for future events . help the trucks deliver the samples faster . not sure how maybe get them an extra staff member ? but the samples on some trucks were coming slowly , so that needs to improve . . better location , maybe not on dirt , and maybe a little larger . once the lines got up to people , the going was cramped and it was taking a long time to get your samples . . maybe a lower price for tickets ? seemed kinda steep for the amount of food each person received . all in all , i enjoyed the food , but the rest of the logistics , not so much .

0,"we ve been in the market looking for a church for the family to start attending . chandler christian seemed to be a nice offering since they are located fairly close to the house and have a decent size to offer something for each group parents children . i ve gotten some good reviews from a family that i know that attends . i love that they have a service on saturday , as that is always a plus for me . the sermon for today was an interesting one , and it seemed to be relevant and on topic for today . the pastor took an updated slant to the story to make it a bit more relevant to today s time . my husband was even laughing at the pastor s jokes . my mother in law even commented on how she liked the music . i did notice that the verses that they pulled up were not the verses that i remember . i believe it s due to them using a different version . all of this being said , the service seemed to be a good one . the signage indicated that this was non denomination however , the service reminded me one baptist services from childhood . "
0,"after living blocks away for over a year , i finally took the jump and decided to deal with the long wait to try this place out . got there at on a tuesday night . . . . hour wait . to be expected , but still pretty ridiculous . went next door to bar bianco , ordered a bottle of wine and patiently waited outside . i think that the wait is part of the allure for people . also , after waiting hungry for hours , the food becomes tastier because you are starving . finally get a table at . order the caprese salad and another bottle of wine . the ingredients are very fresh . the mozz is excellent , the tomatoes are very very fresh and tasty and the basil was great as well . the server didnt make any recommendations on wine or food . a bit odd . given that the wait is hours and that it s pricy for a pizza joint , you d think that the service would be excellent . not at all the case . this guy acts like everyone here is a regular . the reality is that with hour waits for a table , i don t have time to be a regular at this place . we ordered pizzas to try . . . . biancoverde and wiseguy . they were pretty good , again with good ingredients . i wouldn t say it was the best pizza i ve ever had , but very tasty . asked for some balsamic to go with the mozz and tomatoes . . . had to ask the server times , finally we snagged a food runner , she got it for us . i shouldnt have to ask for something times . i mean really , this place only has like tables . . . pay attention to the guests . i guess the moral here is that trying this place is all about the experience and saying that you ve been there . while bianco is good you can go to parlor or cibo and get very good comparable pizza without a hour wait . is it good , yes . is it worth the wait , nope . "
1,i had southwest salad . red velvet cheesecake mmmmmmm
1,"will review after i eat . ok so we ordered a mongolian beef combo plate , sesame chicken yum and pork fried rice , and sweet and sour pork . this was really really good food . good prices . when we are in the area we will definitely go back . "
1,"you know how you poke fun at people who go to a steakhouse and they order something like chicken or seafood ? i m one of those people , but this time i teamed my seafood with steak ! they had a prix fixe menu that carried over from their new year s eve dinner , but i skipped over that . . . i have to say , i loved my sirloin and pieces of shrimp . shrimp was done correctly not rubbery or charred and gasp it was actually de veined . i can t tell you how i ve gone to nicer restaurants and their shrimp wasn t de veined . so that alone got a little happy dance from me . food was a bit on the salty side , but it didn t make me have a massive thirst craving when we left the restaurant . server was friendly and knowledgeable , which was great ! hubby ordered his prime rib , but they didn t have it blue which was the way he wanted it . it s all good , they still brought him out some of the rarest prime rib i ve seen in a long time . . . for an appetizer we ordered bacon wrapped scallops . i am a firm believer of bacon makes everything good ! and it did . the sauce that came with the dish was delicate and flavorful . the fresh rolls that came minutes before the entree was served were my favorite kind light and fluffy on the inside while the outer layer had enough crunch that satisfied me , yet didn t make me feel like i was about to chip any teeth . i can t wait to go back and try some of their other dishes ! "
0,"this place was highly recommended by various websites , so i gave it a shot when i was in scottsdale . the service was great and the food was good . we sat in the bar area which was lively . it feels like a neighborhood hangout , so everyone looked like they were friends and having a good time .

1,"reddddddd robin . . . . . yum . whiskey river bbq burger is really all i get here so i cant speak to any other thing . its just hard to stray away from that good of a burger . when i was here most recently , i ordered the sweet potato fries instead of the normal fries . . . . they were great . . . however they dont have a sauce for them and there is also no brown suger or anything on them to take them to the next level . . . so you end up with good fries that get bland after about . comeon red robin , develop a sauce to go with those fries . as always , the staff was very friendly and attentetive . i always seem to get good service here .

1,good food and freindly staff . they have a nice selection on the menu . after seeing the table next to me i wish i d of had the house specialty . . . . blueberry pancakes . next time . . . . . . . . 
0,"i love the outdoor space at this restaurant . we had a very friendly waiter serve us . we started out with a delicious gin cucumber cocktail which was so refreshing . for an appetizer we had the chicken arugula flatbread that was tasty but definitely could of used a bit more flavor . the caesar salad made with kale was so salty that we were not able to eat much of it . the romaine salad was okay , nothing special . the entree , halibut was so dry it was totally inedible . the roasted vegetables were just so so . i ate here in december and loved it but this time i was very disappointed . i am in no hurry to return , except for a drink .

1,"please excuse this review as i am writing it as i come to from my food coma . we just moved to phoenix and at the time of dining we were not familiar with the fox restaurant group . we happened upon cd on accident on a tuesday night . i must say the place was pretty hoppin for an early week night . we ordered the pretzels with fondue , the fried chicken and the steak . it was so good we didn t even speak to each other through the entire sitting . it was the kind of meal you don t mind having indigestion after because you get the pleasure of re tasting the deliciousness . gross , i know , but you know what i m talking about ! the server we had was as good as a ghost . we never wanted for anything but he left us alone . i wasn t super crazy about the monkey bread but my honey ate it like we hadn t had a ridiculously large meal minutes before . i d kinda like to shave off like a of a star because the staff was ultra trendy indie as were a majority of the patrons . they looked like h m and urban outfitters threw up all over them but if that s the gimmick i m ok with it since the food was so amazing . "
0,"the restaurant reminds me of a quaint little countryside caf . it gives me that homey feeling like a mom and pop store instead of the chain restaurant that it is . i like how whatever entr e you order from the menu you can get a complete meal from it . each entr e comes with a drink , bread , soup or salad , and their spumoni ice cream for dessert . however , if you want italian food , you re not going to get it here . it s a very americanized version of italian food . they do have all the classics the pastas , lasagnas , etc . i ve been here several times and tried a few of their dishes . spaghetti vesuvius cute name to start off . spicy chicken sausage and meatballs with mushroom . i didn t think it was that spicy , but it was extra salty . it s a very flavorful dish , however the individual tastes are all mushed together . the noodles are a bit tough for me perhaps undercooked . however some people like it a bit tough . gourmet jumbo crab ravioli there s not a lot of ravioli pieces in the dish . the edges that were not covered in the pesto alfredo sauce was dry . i did like that they used fresh crab meat in the ravioli . the creamy sauce was not bad and it wasn t too overpowering in my mouth . it was able to taste pesto sauce and still enjoy the texture of the crab . baked lasagna this is the best of the i ve had . it has kinds of cheese , ground beef , and pork . first of all they gave you a huge piece of lasagna . then they topped it with mounds of marinara sauce . you may have to remove some of the sauce if it s too much for you . the noodles were cooked tender enough for my taste , but it was still able to hold its shape . and the meat was blended well with all the flavors of the dish . i do like the cute little serving they have of the spumoni ice cream . it s a great blend of pistachio , chocolate and strawberry . and it s just the right amount after a large meal . maybe one of these days i ll go back just to try their chocolate desserts . if you like an american spin on italian food , then you would like this place . it s a convenient place to eat after shopping at the mall and their quick service is great if you re crunched for time . but the food is just average and not that special . "
1,"this is my favorite place to get thai and i have not found a place to rival it . now it s not perfect . i got on a regular basis they know me when i walk in now . . . i go that much . the service is either great or slow , and the heat ratings varies enough that you can be surprised . the decor isn t fancy and it s hard to find from the street . now that being said , the food is always great and across multiple dishes on the menu . i m always satisfied with my lunch . it gets busy every week day during lunch because of the intel crowd so show up before noon . for dinner and the weekends , it s never that busy , so a great time to go if you have time . "
1,"finally , a great asian fusion restaurant . the service was super friendly . they even got me yoo zu tea because they didn t have honey . server was great also and gave us recommendations about the amount and food choices because we asked very professional . now , the food . . . spicy wontons mmmm deliciously fried to perfection and i absolutely love that wasabi sauce shumai ehhh . . though a lot of people on yelp liked it , the skin was a little hard for me sesame tofu cute little deep friend tofu cubes shabu style miso with shrip warm light soup , definitely a must try red thai curry omygosh , that almost took off my tastebuds . . i wouldn t recommend it unless you like spicy beyond jalapenos overall , a great experience , delicious food , nice ambiance . oh , everything fried tasted non greasy and rather healthy a rare treat .

1,best sushi in town . 
1,"i ve been coming here for several years . can t find my first review . i guess it was too long ago . so here comes another one . the woman who runs the place . i ve forgotten her name . she is one of the most gracious , friendly , and kind people you can ever hope to meet . when i go there , sometimes with and some times without my wife , i alway order the small sausage sandwich . with ajvar and onion , this can t be beat no matter how you my search around . the sausages , cevap , are delicious and what s unusual is that the bread is almost as good as the sausages . simply delicious from all points of view . they make their own sausages and their own bread from scratch . in fact they make everything from scratch right there in the restaurant . their soups are do die for . a very favorite of ours . i give this a star because in the bosnian jugoslavian cuisine catagory , this can t be beaten . one more thing worth mentioning her baklava is top of the mark . it s not as sweet as what you find in other restaurants . everything is simply top shelf . "
1,"i love minimalism . if you can class up a place with a less is more approach , then you ve exceeded the abilities of of the american population . fortunately for the cen pholks lisa g has this aptitude that transcends through her decor and into her simplistic , but delicious organic food . now , here s my deal you put prosciutto on your menu and and i m gonna get b boy on your hardwood floors like ozone in breakin . lisa g s breakbeats the hell out of their prosciutto sandwich with caramelized onions , parm cheese , fig jam , and arugula on an italian loaf . a side of balls and their alamos ridge malbec and i m fresh . service ? never had a bad experience , but who cares ? the food outshines any flaws of a young dine in .

1,i had dinner at frank albert s while attending a conference at the hotel . normal i try not to eat at hotel restaurants due to overcharging and quality of the food . i decided to try frank albert s based on the reviews from tripadvisor . tripadvisor rates this restaurant as number two in phoenix . we where seated on the patio next to the open fire pits . how romantic except i was with my work colleagues . frank albert s is perfect for a date or anniversary . the location is nested in the luxury hotel setting directly below some kind of canyon . i ordered the fillet mignon . yummy ! ! everything on the menu looked so good . frank albert s also had a great wine list . my work colleagues were very happy with my dinner choice . i used opentable to make the table reservation . i would definitely come back frank albert s if i was in the area .

1,"it s usually a ghost town at the downtown phoenix bars , but when a game and or concert is happening , suddenly the bars are bustling . such was the case last night at majerle s , former phoenix suns player dan marjerle s sports bar . with the beyonce concert across the street at the arena and a d backs game at the ball park , phoenix was a hoppin . my friend and i stopped into majerle s , which i ve been to a few times before , for dinner and drinks before going to see beyonce . i had a cheeseburger and cesar salad . while i realize it s hard to mess up a cesar salad , my salad was seriously the best cesar i ve ever had . and my burger was packed with flavor . no wonder aol named them best burgers two years in a row . we also had a wonderful chocolate martini with vanilla vodka , not creme based here . and on fridays if you re in the mood to really start the night , the bar offers a corona or pacifico with a shot of tequila for as part of their sizzlin friday special . my only complaint was that our waitress suddenly went m . i . a for about minutes when we were trying to close our tab so we could go to the show . but i m still going to cut them some slack because this is one of a few fun places to drink in the downtown area . hot tip a second majerle s will be opening in chandler in the fall .

0,la condesa is in a rather unassuming location in phoenix . but has a nice atmosphere when you get inside . the first thing i noticed was their huge salsa bar . we sat down and were brought menus and chips . i tried most of their salsas . they all had their own very unique flavor . the peanut salsa was really interesting . my favorite was their tomatillo salsa . i ordered the oaxaca mole taco and a carne asada taco . the mole was excellent with great flavor . the carne asada was bland and flavorless . . . huh ? i dumped salsa on the carne asada taco and when finished was rather disappointed in that particular offering . also ordered their calabacitas . they were seasoned well and tasted great . i had a bite of my partner s pork taco and it was amazing . i am glad we found la condesa and i will definitely visit again to try some more of their menu offerings . 
0,"i am a fan of taco stands in general , but . . . . this location consistently ruins my beloved bacon , potato , egg and cheese breakfast burrito . every now and then they get it just right , but most of the time there s something missing from it . the bacon is frequently burned to a crisp , and the eggs . . . oh the poor eggs . they are browned beyond all recognition and sometimes just a thin layer of bubbly burned stuff .

0,"i had high hopes for the habit since i live only a couple miles away , but it was mostly disappointing for me . i m vegetarian , so i have no idea how their meat burgers taste , and they may be the best in the world for all i know , but the veggie burger was a tasteless lump for the most part . i do give them kudos for having a veggie burger , but either put more effort into it , or take it off the menu and go full on meat ! the service was nice , and i like the design of the place , but there are too many good veggie burgers to be had in the valley to waste my time eating this one . parking lot is super cramped , so if you need your meatburger fix , then don t come right at or , unless you want to park in someone s yard .

0,"okay . . . this was very surprising since it was just voted best southwestern food in phx mag s best of the valley issue . . . and thus , it made us want to have a visit . i love southwestern food . . . and i was very let down by this place . i feel like i should give it stars . . . but as an a ok rating , i just can t . if stars were for ok food then i d give it stars . but truly , i have . . . i have had better . phx mag said to try the crab cakes , which we did , and they were delicious . very happy with them and therefore expected the entrees to be just as great . . . but they weren t . i had the salmon , which the waitress recommended and it was such a bummer . it had way too many conflicting tastes going on that didn t seem to blend at all . i lost my appetite after a few bites . my boyfriend had the shrimp tacos which were just . . . average . we were really disappointed . again , the crab cake appetizer was great and the two margaritas were as well the tontorita and the prickly pear both very , very yummy . but overall , if phx mag continues to recommend more lame oid meals , i m gonna have to start using it as wrapping paper instead of a go to guide for great meals in this town .

1,"on a cold winter day , the craving for hot comfort in a bowl makes a person do strange things . it found me driving to a kind of shady part of mesa , while braving the cold winds in search of a perfect bowl of ph . my new holy grail of vietnamese restaurants is ph th nh , located in a rundown strip mall on southern and extension . a good vietnamese restaurant is usually kind of old , slightly dingy and super cheap , and in this case all the basics were met and exceeded . ph th nh is a no frills kind of place . inside it screams for a makeover . though clearly from another era , it is clean and functional . the service is friendly and the kitchen is fast . there might be a slight familiarity here the owners of ph th nh and my favorite central vietnamese joint da v ng are brothers . the menus of the two places are almost identical , and they offer a lot . the no . ch gi is what good vietnamese cooking is all about . two golden brown , crunchy egg rolls filled with shrimp and pork are hands on and interactive . served with a plate of lettuce leaves and herbs , you wrap the egg roll in lettuce and garnish with mint and cilantro , then dunk them into the house made n ? c ch m , a sweet and spicy dipping sauce . the fresh lettuce and herbs cut through the richness of the egg roll , which on its own might be slightly oily . applying the same hands on approach , the no . b nh x o . replaces the rolls with a pan fried rice flour crepe . the exterior is slightly crispy , while the soft interior is filled with shrimp and bean sprouts . of all the b nh x o i ve tried , this version is by far my favorite . it s full of flavor and texture . ph pronounced like the bad word is not only fun to say , but fun to eat . eight versions of the noodle soup are offered , from traditional beef to chicken . pay attention to the menu description when ordering since you might wind up with unfamiliar cuts of meat . i m adventurous and love the textures of beef tendon and tripe , so i was in heaven when my steaming bowl of no . ph ph th nh . arrived . the broth was incredibly fragrant with clove and star anise . this really should be made into an air freshener . along with the condiments at the table , the soup comes with a plateful of basil and bean sprouts . but also include limes and chilis to add texture , flavor and depth to your pho experience . for something hearty and comforting , the no . m b kho . is a bowl of chewy egg noodles filled with a beef stew . tender pieces of stewed carrots and beef grace the rich and complex flavors of the dark and tasty brew . if you re carbohydrate loading , order a slab of french bread to absorb all of the bone warming elixir at the bottom of the bowl . for food like this , a little shady is worth the drive .

1,"i m going to be an uptight stickler here , and only review the pizzeria portion of lgo since the grocery part can be done under as a separate business . i hope others follow suit . sorry , i m super nerdy about this stuff . anyways , the sourdough crust is my favorite pizza crust in all the land . i love the flavor and how it s always glistening with oil when it comes to the table . the toppings are really special here . if you even remotely like avocado , get their avocado pizza . the lemon zest puts it over the top . the corn with goat cheese is my next favorite . the only one that i haven t liked is the the rocket man . it tasted fine , but the heavy toppings were too much for the thin crust . we also had the fortune of trying their grilled artichoke appetizer one evening . i couldn t get enough of it ! it s not on the menu seasonal item i m sure , but we asked about it when we saw plates of it go by . extra bonus points for the large selection of cheap pizza wines . any time i can get a decent bottle at a restaurant for under , i m a happy camper .

1,"yes , i am a fan . particularly of the brunches ! they bake their pancakes which makes them ooooh so good . the king s cakes are delicious and are baked with bananas and chocolate in them and served with peanut butter which i m personally not a fan of . the portions are very very generous . on a nice day , the patio is great . comfy seats , evap cooler outside , misting system . most people don t know about their brunches i assume , since the entire place was empty when we were there at am . the dinners are great as well . the pulled pork sandwich and their pizzas are surprisingly good ! it definitely has a commercial feel to it , but i believe it s a local business which i m all for .

1,"i indulged big time at indulge burgers more during fat tuesday yesterday . there are a tremendous variety , including many healthy options such as a turkey or veggie burger . the best part i like is that you can build your own burger with all sorts of yummy toppings . i had the turkey burger , and the turkey was one of the best i have ever tasted . sometimes you can taste like of the darker meats and fatty parts , but i felt like this burger was very clean and lean . i would highly recommend the sweet potatoe fries that you can order . you can deep those fries in what tastes like a warm marshamallow dip . the price is not too bad either for what i call a luxury burger .

0,"nice looking place with average food and horrible service . everything took forever and no one came by to see how we were doing . we literally watched our server going around setting tables and taking napkins off of empty tables rather than making himself available to us . he wandered around from table to table in a completely unoccupied area of the restaurant the majority of the time we were there . the food was luke warm and nothing special . i was only here once so i hate to be so down on the place , but based on the other reviews my experience sounds pretty typical . don t waste your money .

0,"if you have a family with a lot of little kids , are absolutely happy with your body , and only want to leave your house to change your scenery , this is your place . if you are looking for a great workout , this is not your place . the hours are pretty bad and you have to plan your schedule around them . the cardio machines are good . the variety of weights is okay but they are all over the place . they have a suggestion box , but they don t take them seriously . the classes used to be good , but now the quality has gone down . the zumba class used to be my favorite , but not so much anymore . they should have different levels , but there is only one and it is slow . there are kids all over the place . i dont understand what parent would want their year old girl learning to shake her butt , but i can t judge , i don t have a kid . maybe when i have one i would want her to learn to dance low and shake it , so she can be asked to go on mtv . the majority of the classes are in the middle of the day , which is great if you dont have a job or anything to do with your time . yoga ? there were a couple good instructors , but they are not there anymore . what do you guys do to your instructors ? why do they run away ? why do you make it hard to get a good workout ? i dont think i am asking for much here , just a place that i can get a good workout .

1,"after unsuccessfully attempting a walk in gel at the posh looking sundrops nail salon with my two year old in tow , i was drawn to a half deserted strip mall just down the street and a small space in the center labeled andy s nails . i yelped the place and saw the decent reviews so i walked in and was immediately attended to by the friendliest faces i ve seen in a while . despite the fact that i was short one babysitter , they began work on my nails right away and when my toddler got restless , one of the very nice owners picked her up and carried her around for minutes ! not only do they now offer gelish gel manicures but they offer more colors than many other arcadia biltmore camelback corridor nail salons and they re cheaper by anywhere from ! i m definitely going back and going back soon ! my toes are lonely . . .

1,"i really like this place . however it does suck time like no other place . somehow evertime you are there for over hrs ? i usually try on items to get that fits well , and cry a half dozen times about being fat then i cruise the little kids clothes because the mens clothes are to large for me and the womens are cut weird . one of my boobs is like a rd the size of the other so its soo hard to find clothes that dont make me look like a cancer survivor . anyway , good finds here . try the clothes on even if it says the size is smaller than you wear . a lot of times it says one size but is really another . my girlfriend bought . jeans for . a piece because it said they were a when they were really a . p . s . anyone know where to find some dress vests ? the womens ones are too short and make me look like i have flowing love handles and the mens vests are to big in the shoulders and ribs . i think i should try maybe a kids vest ? thoughts ?

1,"there is nothing i enjoy more than a great sunday brunch and st francis did not let me down . the food and atmosphere were the perfect way to start off a relaxing day . we had to wait about minutes before getting seated but it was no problem because our server brought us drinks while we sat and enjoyed the live jazz music . my friend and i started off by sharing a giant cinnamon roll topped with caramel sauce . so good . we destroyed the pastry in minutes , which left both of us wondering how we were going to eat our meals . fortunately , we are both gluttons and were able to pull ourselves together for round . i had the eggs benedict and roasted potatoes and my friend ordered the wood oven baked eggs . both were delicious . the only thing i didn t like was that the tables were very close together . at times it felt like we were dining with our neighbors . overall i would highly recommend st francis brunch and i am eager to return again .

1,"a weekend of debauchery was spent here when i was . somehow we broke two lamps that were hanging on the walls . like high up on the walls . like above head level . don t ask , because i don t remember how it happened either . we tried to steal lamps from other rooms , but the maids kept catching us . so we wrote , i o u lamps on one of the lampshades and left it at that . one night , my friend jonathan got really drunk and angry and lonely , went to the pool , and threw all of the poolside furniture into the pool . we seriously destroyed that motel . i m not kidding , there was so much filth in one of our rooms that you couldn t see the carpet . i felt really , really bad for whoever had to clean that up . but the best part was that we didn t get charged for any damage we caused . thanks , motel ! no wonder my useful points are so low . . . i use yelp more often to showcase my anecdotes than to actually review things . i m useless !

1,"i had a great burger experience here and intend to return the next time i am craving a fuddburger . i also got to introduce a friend to fuddrucker s for the first time , so it was a cherry poppin adventure . not only are the burgers here tasty , but i love the fact that you get to pick and choose the toppings from their self serve produce and condiment bars . one of my favorite things on french fries is heinz sauce and fuddrucker s is truly awesome for including that amongst its vast condiment selection . as a professed condiment whore , i was thrilled to discover a new flavor of tabasco i have never encountered before . . . and i like to think i really know my tabasco products , having lived in louisiana for years . this fuddruckers special orders the sweet spicy variety of tabasco which is not only great on a burger , but would work as an egg roll dipping sauce . knowing that i must have it for home use , my dining partner graciously approached the manager who arranged to allow him to purchase a bottle . this was just one example of how efficient , helpful , and friendly the staff here are . next visit , i will demand to meet the one who refers to himself only as mr . crusty baker see photos . the restaurant also has a lot of shiny fun decor evoking shameless americana and route roadside culture . the bright colors and the overindulgence in fast food goodness contributes to a heightened state of arousal that can only be described as a burger party contact high . you can just feel the burger love . . . the afterglow punctuated by the difficult click of the seat belt as you strap in for a ride back to a somber , less gluttonous reality .

1,we love roys . the service is usually outstanding and the food is wonderful . the ambience is nice and usually pretty hopping on a saturday . my water glass is constantly being refilled because the people roy s employ are totally on the ball . we have dined here times over the past years and have never had a mediocre meal . they also have a delicious vegetarian menu if you ask your server . the wine list is comprehensive and they are known for their creative cocktails . we have dined here on both special occasions and regular saturday nights . it is kind of like being on vacation when we go since it is located in the gorgeous jw marriott . . . . definitely in my top three phoenix area restaurants . 
1,"sorry jesse had such a bad experience here . i have been using this place for about , well , from the week they opened as it is so close to my office . they have never lost or damaged any of my clothing , and i drop my wife s delicate stuff off here as well for dry cleaning . they have also always been true to their word on when i can pick up my clothes although i am usually days late on the pick up one benefit of being a clothes horse i guess . two doors down from dunkin , so fantastic to drop and pick the rags and then grab a cup o joe before hitting the office . the women who work there aren t too hard on the eyes , either , which is always a plus . hard to believe they are still using a dot matrix printer , but that has no impact on service .

1,"my dad and i decided to try great wall because he had heard many reviews about the place and everyone insisted that you had to come try the dim sum . since i was in town visiting , it gave us the perfect excuse to go . i m happy to report that the experience was most excellent at great wall and that it lived up to the hype . upon getting there , we were given a number to wait as the restaurant was completely full , there were probably people there dining , however , we were seated within minutes . as soon as we sat down , the carts started rolling by with various plates of items to try . the pancake , shu mai , shrimp , duck , and sliced beef inside a wrapper are highly recommended , all were excellent . i did have a bit of trouble taking the shrimp out of the steam container because their rice wrappers were sticking a bit , but that does happen . i would advise that if you have an allergy to shrimp that you make sure to ask the server what is in some of the items because they do come with shrimp , including their egg rolls . since my dad has a shrimp allergy we did have to watch for that . i did want to try their egg rolls but i would have been the only one eating them , and they were big enough to make a meal in itself . the sliced duck was one of the best i have had at a restaurant , well cooked with crispy tasty skin , and not too many bones to get in the way , and very reasonably priced at . for a plate . most other dim sum plates are . or . so you can end up eating a lot for a very reasonable price . if you love dim sum and are willing to wait a few minutes for a table , but you will get fast service afterward , this really is the place you want to go to . there are still so many more dishes to try as well , but that will be for another trip .

1,"i have to admit i was a bit hesitate about staying here after reading some of the previous reviews . we stayed in the section of the hotel which is behind the convention center part . i d recommend this if you want something quiet where you won t get noise from the front parking area or pools . yes , i said pools . . . a great thing for those of us who only wanted to relax and get some sun . every staff member that we encountered walking the property was friendly and always acknowledged us . we had a two queen room and the room itself was very large and i liked that every room has either a patio or balcony . our view happened to be of the basketball and tennis court but it was nice to be able to go outside and sit on the patio in the morning to have coffee and relax . i assume that we had a room that had already been renovated since the bedding looked new . . . and the bed was so comfortable ! the breakfast buffet is good and it s nice that you can order eggs anyway you like them as part of that . other than that we mostly just had drinks while laying by the pool . the only negative thing that comes to mind is the fact that the toilets are very loud when flushed . i have no idea if it was the rooms next to us or above us but every time someone flushed a toilet in the middle of the night i woke up . . . . i am a light sleeper but still , if there are more renovations to be done i hope this is something they can address . the location is great and i can t wait to book my next trip back .

0,"pei wei is always busy , that s gotta mean something right ? wrong . there are restaurants that serve billions yet all they serve is a gross mystery . pei wei is no mystery though , the food is cooked in an open air kitchen . even so , if there were such a thing as asian fast food , pei wei would be cleaner version of it . most pei wei s are situated in pompous locations where ever there is an aj fine foods , but atleast they aren t located in the ghetto . as far as the food goes , it is about as americanized as you can get . so if you live in america and have american taste buds , it will appeal to you . unfortunately if you want authentic asian food you won t find it at pei wei . i don t understand why they even bother to put chopsticks on the table , the rice isn t even sticky enough to pick it up with . they are for decoration . they are part of the fake asian dining experience . apparently , pei wei serves food manadrian style from thailand , vietnam , japan , korea , and china . in the words of bill lumbergh , ooo . . yeahh . . i m just not sure about that . having traveled to china i can honestly tell you that chinese food is different . apart from the rice , the food lacks vegetable oil and garlic . in china those two ingrediants are used in many dishes and pei wei lacks them . when i first started visiting pei wei i ordered the sweet and sour , but i got sick of it . sometimes the meat would be tough , sometimes the chicken would clump together all nastily . what i get now a days and what i got on this particular day was mandarin kung pao . even though the dish is spicy , that doesn t mean it has to be dry and it was . what it was missing was some catalyst to bring out the spicy flavors and make them more vibrant . the dishes at pei wei are family style meaning they are meant to be shared with several people . a dish and a drink will end up costing you about . if each person gets one dish , that s a lot of food , probably enough to feed a small village in africa somewhere . it would be nice if they served each dish in two styles , family and single , large and small . family style is great if you always visit pei wei with your family . but if you are out for lunch with people from work you might not want to share your food with your co workers . they aren t your family . you don t know them . pei wei is a modern asian diner that is probably better than most of the mom and pop asian diners out there , even if most of the food is cooked by mexi i mean asians .

0,"i will still call it the counter , because i m the curmudgeonly type that is sometimes slow to accept change . who is chloe ? fox restaurants need not have changed the name just to eliminate the boutique . . . the food has always been tasty . the split pea soup is absolutely amazing . the hot turkey sandwich is delicious , the chopped salad is a spot hitter . i don t think the prices are too terribly high , after all , it s in kierland , which isn t exactly a discount enclave . the service . ah , the service . first , let me spare the hard workers in my tirade . the cooks , and those who actually are putting together food and cleaning , do a fabulous job . the servers or register runners , have been incredibly disappointing . they invoke this kind of back story imagery mom ! my gas card didn t work , i almost didn t make it to dana s party , i mean , can you imagine if i would have run out of gas , and had to talk to a commoner ? ? wtf , mom ! shannon , your father and i decided that you need to pick up a part time job , we will still pay for your bmw , your insurance , your condo , your cable , your birth control , your health insurance and your part time college education , but we think it s time you worked about hours a week . omg ! this is soooo ridiculous and unfair , mom , wtf ! and that is how shannon name made up came to work at the counter . and that is why she sucks at service . and that is why she doesn t appreciate how hard the rest of us work to purchase an sandwich , and how a simple smile , some humor , and a thanks for coming in , or how is everything tasting today , could make such an enormous difference in someone s dining albeit counter style experience . instead , after ordering the chopped salad and the pea soup from shannon , the cook brought me my soup , and i enjoyed it . and i waited . and waited . there was no ticket , there was no chopped salad in the works . the prep area is fully visable . i graciously asked the cook if there was an order in for a chopped salad , and she said , oh no , i m so sorry , let me make one on the fly for you ! . she did , i ate , it was delicious , and i thanked her . shannon then presented me with my bill a full few minutes after i sat in front of an empty plate , i paid , and as she handed me my change she said , bye . i don t think i need to elaborate on that . so to the shannon s of the world hurry up and get a rich boyfriend and become a trophy wife so the rest of us don t have to deal with your shitty service , bad attitude and hateful unsmiling demeanor . and to the awesome cooks and service folks out there who manage at least a smile , bless you . bless you , every one .

0,"my boyfriend and i had heard about the great food and romantic ambiance of coup des tartes so we decided to check it out . overall it was fine but we didn t think it lived up to the hype . we knew ahead of time that it was byob but decided to forgo bringing alcohol because of the corking fees . no biggie . we enjoyed the lemonade and minted iced tea they served us . we weren t hungry enough for appetizers , so we just ordered salads and entrees . the salads came out quickly and did not disappoint . i ordered the springtime salad and absolutely loved it . mixed greens with organic apples , red onions , dried cranberries , chevre , and candied walnuts with apple cider vinaigrette . they put just the right amount of dressing on it so it was coated but not drenched . my boyfriend ordered the parmigiano and said it was very good as well . it was your basic caesar salad with homemade dressing . both salads were surprisingly large and could have satisfied us for dinner if we had ordered appetizers as well . then came the entrees . well , sort of . we sat there until we started to wonder if they were out hunting for our food . then we thought maybe we should have ordered an appetizer after all to close the gap a little between the salads and the entrees . but really , why should we have to pay for something we weren t hungry for just so they can get their pacing right ? anyhow , the entrees eventually came . i ordered the lambshank and my boyfriend ordered the pork . the lamb fell right off the bone and i didn t even have to use my knife ! it came with a side of israeli couscous , which i thoroughly enjoyed . my only complaint about this dish would be the sauce . it was a harissa spiced vegetable ragout with dried fruits . for some reason i was expecting something a little thicker . i felt like the lambshank was sitting in a soup . actually , this sauce did taste like a vegetable stew my mom used to make when i was little that i didn t like . it was a little bit of a turnoff to me , but not their fault i guess . how were they to know ? i ate it anyway because the meat was cooked so well . my boyfriend s pork tenderloin was also cooked very well . it sat atop a bed of risotto and also came with asparagus . i tried a bite of it , but my dish was so flavorful that it tasted bland in comparison so i can t give it a fair review . he said it was excellent and finished every last bite on the plate , so i ll take his word for it . the service was . . . . ok . it was fine in the beginning but while they were out hunting for our food between the salads and entrees we were completely neglected and left thirsty . after we got our entrees it picked up again and was fine until we left . the ambiance ? quaint and pretty , yes . but quaint does not necessarily equal romantic in my book . we were seated in a small table jammed into the corner . the size of the table was fine for two people , but it was way too close to the table next to us which had a party of four seated at it . every time someone got up from it to go to the restroom , their backs were right in my face . we had a nice view of the patio out the window right next to us . that was until another couple was seated right on the other side of the glass . my boyfriend felt very uncomfortable for half of our meal because he felt like he couldn t look to his right or else he d be looking straight at the guy sitting inches away from him . i was lucky enough to have been seated right next to the wall so i had the view with a little bit of privacy . the room could have also benefited from some white noise in the background because we could hear everyone s conversations and felt like we couldn t talk at a normal volume without other people hearing . there was some very soft music playing in the background but it could have been turned up a notch or two . in a nutshell , i d give the food four stars but the ambiance and service two and a half stars . i d go there again to give something else on the menu another try , but i d request a table on the patio to get out of that cramped little house .

1,"upper crust is like grimaldi s on steroids . the two places have nearly identical decor and the pizza is extremely similar . upper crust uses a little more cheese which is nice , but they also use cornmeal on the crust which i am not crazy about . the wings are huge and delicious , especially with the honey bbq sauce . the meatballs are nothing special with or without the mozzarella cheese , but stephanie h would disagree . happy hour is monday friday pm to pm and on wednesdays they offer half off on bottles of wine . overall , it is a very good pizza and i plan on returning . next time i ll be giving that pizza cookie a try . i really liked upper crust , but grimaldi s in old town is still my favorite for traditional ny style thin crust pizza .

1,"so as our last restaurant in phoenix , i decided to visit green , due to its great reviews and popularly . i got the kung po with mock beef , which was only , which is super cheap and really good . the restaurant is hidden in like a little corner , so it s a little hard to find , but the interior is nice and beautiful . as a tip , just remember that you seat yourself and you have to get the menus at the counter . took us a while to realized that . overall , super cheap , really good and nice place .

1,"fantastic meal . fantastic experience . i am a vegetarian . i cook a lot and am very conscious of food preparation , starting with sourcing . i don t just patronize farmers markets , i patronize certain farmers markets . . . . that sort of thing . long story short , if i am going to dine out , i want something very special . very special . quiessence exceeded my expectations at almost every turn . i dined there with my son and daughter in law . . . both truly expert cooks . . . more knowledgeable than i . all of us were blown away by our meal . we got the farmers feast without the wine pairings so we could choose our own wine . i got the vegetarian . . . they got the carnivore or ominvore or whatever they call it ! . truthfully , labels are irrelevant . it s all in the taste . . . and the tastes are sublime ! i was impressed by how much variety was in each plate . theirs were similar but each a little different . more importantly , there was a marvelous progression of very carefully crafted flavors . the most impressive thing the chef clearly wanted to offer his own interpretations . that he did so while letting the fabulous ingredients speak for themselves is truly remarkable . the setting is beautiful . the servers are unpretentiously proud of their community and the work they are doing and seemed to enjoy our enjoyment as well . our only criticism and it is minor is that although the desserts were beautifully crafted , we felt that they did not reflect the intentions of local sustainability . there is so much wonderful local fruit used in other courses , i might add ! . . . perhaps adding some to the desserts would carry out the theme more completely . . . i m sure the chefs creativity can conjure more ideas than i ! that said , i will return ! as often as possible ! quiessence and the farm at south mountain are an unparalleled resource for the phoenix community . . . easy to get to from any part of the valley . . . no excuses , folks ! . . . go !

1,"yeah , yeah , i know there are already like fifty something reviews for this place , most of them four or five stars , i don t care . here s one more , another twig on the bonfire celebrating richardson s awesomeness . . . the food s the same awesome new mexican cuisine as dick s hideway around the corner , but eating here is a totally different experience . the dark pueblo interior with native american rugs surrounding the high backed booths provides a great deal of privacy for you and your party . i recommend any and all of the seafood dishes my favorites include the shrimp quesadilla and the scallops . . . omg the scallops , so good when i think about em they make me lose control and type text message shorthand like omg . of course my friends constantly remind me that as much as i love the food here , i can t truly appreciate it because i don t eat the meat dishes , which , according to them , are even better . and they re probably right . they usually are . went with a group of last week , which seems to be about as large as the booths at richardson s can handle for much larger groups there s a private room available at dick s . service was super friendly and extremely efficient . yeah , it can be a little pricy depending on what you order , but in my opinion , totally worth it . sometimes you gotta splurge .

1,"melrose pharmacy is my go to pharmacy . not only is it in my neighborhood , it is independently owned and operated by teresa stickler . her and her husband kurt are people who care about the community . the fact that they provide a level of service that their chain store competitors can only dream of is a is the icing on the cake . they are also lightening quick , dispensing most prescriptions while you wait . moreover , they are a full service pharmacy , they also offer delivery handy when you feel like you are on the verge of death and useful recommendations on the pros and cons on a on non prescription drugs and vitamins often recommending the lower priced generic brand . in addition , you can find a wide variety of homeopathic products , as well as a selection of snacks , books and small gifts . even if you don t need to get a prescription filled , it s worth a visit to check out the retro interior and grab and grab a vintage bottled pop and candy . better yet , stop by on a first friday when the pharmacy features live music , and frequent art shows in the studio in the same complex .

1,house special chicken is a must . this is not a fancy schmancy place so you know the food will be good ! never have had to wait for a table . the banana thingies they give you for dessert are awesome too . i give it stars because of the huge selection . pei wei and pf changs are ok but they have a limited menu . and a large wait ! 
0,"seriously the best am quesadilla i have ever had . it was big and gooey , with just enough browning on the outside of the tortilla to make it a little bit crisp . as an added bonus it was kind of cold outside , so it made a great hand warmer as well . why only stars ? ok , you do have to sit on some questionable outside picnic tables and i don t want to think about how clean the kitchen may or may not be , but the entertainment value of watching tipsy people stumble around while waiting for their food can t be beat .

1,"this target gets the job done . their shelves tend to be in a little disarray , and their makeup selections are generally lacking , but other than superfluous purchases i didn t even need to make , this target has never let me down . the grocery section is probably the cleanest and best in the store . i love perusing these aisles . their clothing section is pretty diverse , but because the store is somewhat small , it s packed in tight . it s a challenge to maneuver the area . the biggest perk is its central location to southern tempe . it s also very rarely busy during the day , which is awesome !

1,they had what i was looking for . . . it wasn t easy to find but after asking people i eventually found it . a folding table and shelving . the place is typically big and laid out like most other home depots . know what to expect when you go and you won t be disappointed but if you want a lot of personal service stick to a local hardware store .

1,"i am just providing a review for the mother and infant care department only , since my wife has just had our second baby delivered here . we really enjoy our stay at this hospital . the facility is very clean and nice . room are good size with shower box inside bathroom , so you can take shower during your stay and care for the mom . during the stay , mom and the caregiver are entitle to have breakfast , lunch , and dinner for free . all you have to do is call and place your orders . the foods are quite quality and the portions are decent . i am really impressed with this . the nurses are all knowledgeable , caring , and nice . they are always there when you call them and need them . since this is our second child , it works out perfectly that the nurses only come by when we call them or when they do their routine checks . so , the rest of the time you are left alone to rest . the hospital where my first child was born was different . they let lots of interns and students come to our rooms all the times for training , so we were constantly bothered . however in my opinion , if it is your first child , you may find that having people around all the time could help you not to worry too much since we all know nothing when the first child come . the reason i didn t give this hospital star is just because our discharge was taking so long . we thought we would be out by am , but we didn t get out until pm . . . they said that because it was on sunday . i think it make sense . overall , i do recommend this hospital for any new mother .

0,"i hate for my first official review to be a one star review but macayo s really disappointed me last night . when i first pulled into the parking lot last night i was surprised to see how many empty parking spaces there were . i immediately got excited because normally any restaurant on bell road any night of the week has a wait . however , when i walked inside i saw a slew of people waiting to be seated . i walked up to the hostess stand and put my name on the list and the hostess did not give me a time quote and when i asked how long it would be she quoted me , not too long . we waited about minutes before being shown to our table which is where the trouble really began . once we were at our table we were quickly greeted by our server yay however , she told us she had another table s drink order to get and then she would be back for ours boo . so we waited for her to take the other two tables drink orders before coming back to take ours . after about minutes we got our fountain drinks and then minutes later she came back to take our food order . then it took about minutes for our food to come out . seriously , minutes . . . . that s about how long i planned to spend at macayo s not how long i planned on waiting for my appetizer of taquitos to take to come out . and to top it off we were missing a side of rice and a side of baja sauce . we decided not to mention it as we did not want to wait another hour for the two items to come out . so , after eating and waiting for our drinks to be refilled times we finally got the check to which the server apologized for our wait . apparently , she couldn t have apologized at all during our minute minute wait she needed to wait until tip time . i don t recommend going to macayos . you might have better luck at any of the other mexican restaurants on bell road .

1,"well , we all went to a going away party here at casey moore s oyster house and the place was fairly nice lots of security around but very limited parking we parked a few blocks away and had to walk in food was good but my onion soup was way to salty though and the dip sandwich was by far the worst item to order on the menu just sliced meat and bread and i had order it . my wife ordered the shrimp scampi and for some reason it came out with a heavy cream sauce , no complaints because it was good but it was not scampi . tuna was perfect i had a chance to taste it and that cooked perfect and i did notice a co worker leave the of the fish and chips on there plate no a good sign . clam chowder was good as a few friends did say they enjoyed it . calamari was off the chain perfect . the server was warm , friendly and polite and had some great suggestions for dinner and was very patient and waited for us to have few rounds before we ordered dinner . the place is pretty big and it seems that if you would come and sit in a different place each time it would be like going to a different place . music was jamming something for everyone . folks were friendly and the place was packed . now , cleanliness it seems like it could use a wipe down , moping an a power wash in a few spots but i guess after a few cold ones you don t see it anymore . will i go back ? yes , i would , affordable food , good music and folks all in a good mood i m there . stars due to they are still a littler ruff around the edges . peace "
0,i ve fequented here often enough to know that all the majority of the games here are all those ticket games and little claw type games . i come to hang out with friends and play some games . i can in on tuesday night around pm and thought to have dinner there since i had a coupon for the place . i really didn t care about price at the time with the coupon . after being seated our waitress got our drinks took our order and everything was fine . after we recieved the food we were left unattended for quite some time . when the waitress finally returned i had to ask for a refill and some ketchup as well . my drink was empty so i would assume that would be something that the waitress would ask but i caught her before she left . my boyfriend did not recieve a single refill the entire night and we were there from pm to pm . we had friends meet us there and we just chatted it up for some time . it wasn t for some time that we realised that the place was bare not just of customers but of staff as well . it was as if they closed the place down and just left us . after the waitress had taken our check and cashed us out that was the last we saw of her . the plates of our food were still in front us the entire time and we had kind of placed them all together so that she could come and just take them . . . kind of thought that the bunch of plates stacked together would give the hint we were done but i guess i shouldn t be so subtle next time . the food was ok at best . nothing bad nothing good in hind sight though if i had to pay full price for what i got if that waitress had left us like she did and i didn t frequent the games i would ve walked out . probably wouldn t notice . all in all go for the games if anything else . the games are even ok that is if they are running . sometimes i come in and games are off or not working . this is just a place that is convienent for myself and friends to meet up .

0,"a new player in the downtown phoenix food scene , bliss is a creation by the folks behind the fez , switch , and ticoz empire . they occupy a buliding once occupied by fate and nine , the former of which was one of my favorite restaurants . entering the restaurant , we were greeted with an odor of mildew and dirty water , which isn t exactly a pleasant way to arrive into an establishment . being the only ones seated in the small space , we were able to really examine it , and i noticed one glaring difference between the way they have it set up and the way it was set up it feels like a cafeteria . the installation of florescent lights , heat lamps , and massive amounts of stainless steel in the open kitchen make this place feel like a lunchroom at high school . whatever , we can deal with it . an overview of the menu showed several options which seemed like drunk food . . . fried everything , cheese crisps , foot long hot dogs , slider burgers , tacos , grilled cheese , etc . apparently comfort food means deap fried grease ? no thanks . i ordered the braised beef tacos , which had the consistency of paste , but were average in taste . my biggest gripe with this place is the microwave not even a turbo chef sitting front and center in the kitchen . look , i understand that some restaurants use microwaves usually not good ones in their kitchen , especially if it s a cold kitchen which this isn t but having it in plain view and audible in the dining room is just atrocious . i truly hope someone from the restaurant reads this and hides the thing . it made me completely lose my appetite when i saw them heating my girlfriend s rice for her chicken skewers in the microwave . yuck . she did mention she was neutral about her food . we are people who go out at least once a day for a meal and try a new place every time , so we know food . everyone we encountered was nice , and the service was very friendly . everyone seemed interested in how well we enjoyed our meal , the space , and they seemed interested in welcoming us back . unfortunately , the place looks kind of makeshift on the rebar side , and like a cafeteria on the bliss side . i m not really sure why it looks makeshift , perhaps it is just because it looks like a temporary wall in the back of the room , or because it looks so bare , but it looks like they are in there just for the time being . i feel compelled to go here again but only for drinks out on the patio . the inside looks like mexico , the food wasn t very good , and the cafeteria microwave issues pretty much summed up this is not a place for a nice night out dining . i also find it interesting how many reviews are by orange heads or people who were here for the vip opening . c mon , try the place before you write a public review of it , and by try i mean eat some food , and actually experience it .

0,"there is a certain sense of nostalgia that exudes from phoenix muni that you don t really get at the newer spring training facilities in arizona . true , it is the oldest still in use , but it feels more intimate and more geared towards the spirit of seeing your team before the season starts . it s less about business and more about getting back into the swing of the things , having a few laughs on the basepads and shaking hands with the people who really live and die by their fandom . most of the seats beyond b and b sides are benches , another throwback , but really , there isn t a bad seat to watch a game . get there early if you re into meeting players and getting autographs and also be prepared to wait in lines for food or drink . even when all the stands are open , they are not enough to service a packed house of hungry fans . bring cash , only a few places accept card .

0,"totally excited to try this place out , my grandparents , my mom and i of us came here for some korean food . it wasn t too busy just pairs of people from nearby offices coming in and out . unlike other korean restaurants , their lunch special selection is very limited . special a consists of a sushi roll with a soda , special b teriyaki beef chicken no soda , or special c , korean bbq spicy chicken . as we were looking at the lunch special board , the lady behind the counter insisted that we should look at their full price menu instead . here comes the awkward part she then asked my mom are you chinese ? even though she is , my mum looked at me all puzzled as in what does that mean ? the lady proceeded by pointing at the seafood pancake section on the menu and saying i don t know why but you chinese like this pancake a lot . good thing my mom didn t hear what she said . . or else . . . so we got the spicy chicken lunch special . , a bulgogi . , and a beef yakisoba . . the cool thing about this place is that it has a mini kimchi buffet bar , with trays of marinated tofu , potato , bean sprout , kimchi , broccoli and some other vegetables . it also has this delicious house special hot sauce . by the time we finished a dish of kimchi , the food came , so it didn t take long . the spicy chicken , came in a bowl about the size of an instant noodle bowl but slightly deeper , was tender , with rice underneath it . the chicken was definitely marinated well however , the last couple of pieces had tendons and big chunks of fat . . . what a bad way to end it . the bulgogi also came in a bowl , with rice underneath . the beef was definitely not marinated fully . the color was super light and the beef was close to tasteless . the biggest disappointment , food wise , was the beef yakisoba . the noodles , occupying most of the styrofoam lunch box , were sweet . then there was an ice cream scoop of rice , topped with pieces , i kid you not , three pieces of dog tag sized , super dry meat . in the end , we just decided to bring the barely touched yakisoba home for my younger brother well , teenage boys tend to eat everything . . . . while my mom transfered the noodles to the plastic bowl since the styrofoam box was lidless , i went to ask for a plastic cover . this is the best part the same lady , stared at me , pointed at the salad bar and said you can t take that home . i thought there was a miscommunication , so i asked again for a lid for the noodles . again , she pointed at the salad bar and said you are not allowed to take the kimchi home . wow seriously ? just b c my grandparents are chinese you assumed we were stashing kimchi in a bowl and trying to sneak it out ? look , i just want to take my noodles home , ok ? she hesitantly gave me a lid . hey , hey you . we chineness peple no steal kimchi becuz confucius say no stealing kimchi . . . only if i said that to her face . . . oh , and when we got home , my brother , aka our food dumpster , took a bite of the yakisoba and never touched it again . conclusion if you want amazing korean food and friendly customer service , please just go to chodang . chodang is wayyy better , hands down"

1,"i just went here for the first time with my boyfriend this afternoon . i got a green apple snow and he got a mocha . . . blast ? or something like that . we both loved them . while the drink was amazing , what was even better was the quality of their boba , they weren t too hard or squishy and they had the perfect taste . the shop was really clean and nice and cool . i also noticed they had battleship and i think checkers and some other board games out for customers to play with . they also had a computer monitor i am guessing for games . i didn t go to look at it . i think there was music on but i can t remember . the service was really fast , but then we were the only ones there . you can t use a debit credit card for an order under so we ordered an extra drink for our friend we were going to visit . we asked if she could make it when we were ready to leave and she was really nice about it . i can t say one bad thing about it . if i find something else on another visit i will update . as of now this is going to be my number one place to get boba .

0,"i expected better . the ambiance is pleasant . it s lit well and the furniture is very new . the booth was comfortable . the bar appears to be a little dark and moody , but in a sultry way . we were there on the sunday before labor day , around pm and it wasn t busy at all . maybe patrons besides us . we were seated right away in a booth . the waiter was very quick to take our order and explained the specials . for the appetizer we ordered the cheese , fruit and crackers . they ran out of crackers and gave us toasted bread soaked in butter instead . we asked if we could have dry bread instead . they obliged . there were pieces of cheese , all of which were the same and brie . seriously , please diversify the cheese plate with more than type of cheese . and have crackers to go with it , since t s on the menu description . my girlfriend and i both ordered a quarter chicken . i had the true jerk sauce and she had the honey truffle sauce . the chicken quality was on par with boston market or costco , maybe even fattier . we were seriously unimpressed . the sauces were good , but definitely did not blow your socks off . you get to choose two sides along with your chicken . i had zucchini and whipped potatoes . the whipped potatoes come with your choice of three ingredients from a list of or so . horseradish , garlic and mesquite sour cream were my choices . the potatoes were excellent , both zesty and filling . overall , i was unimpressed . this place is like an upscale boston market where the chicken is lower quality and the only improvement is in the quality of the sides . the sauces are good , but you can do much better .

0,"we went to the place for breakfast lunch today . it must be a popular spot and was very busy . there were specials of the day , eggs benedict and a french toast stack . both came with a choice of potatoes . i went here based on the reviews from fellow yelpers . my daughter ordered the burger , it came with fries and salad for under . . the burger was very well done , but it was lb of ground beef . the fixings were on the side and it arrived on an unremarkable hamburger bun . the fries were crisp and the salad was fine but it was drenched in a watered down thousand island dressing . my eggs benedict was fine . nothing to make me want to order it again , but not bad either . i would try their pancakes next time . they looked pretty good ! my husband s french toast stack arrived . pieces of french toast with ham , egg and swiss cheese between the layers . kinda like a monte cristo sandwich . they bring out warm maple and berry syrup . my husband liked it . but , said he would try something else next time . i ordered my hashbrowns extra crispy , my husband ordered his burnt , his order came out exactly how i wanted mine . crispy dark golden and cooked well . bummer i had to just eat the top of mine . we also wanted to try the biscuits and gravy . what a big let down . quantity does not equal quality . the biscuits were large , and the gravy bland . our service was ok . the people working there seem nice enough . they were giving out free the place frisbees . they will be closing and will re open at the new location right up the street at st ave and bell rd , in the old margaritas building . hopefully i will be able to update this one day and give a better rating . but for now , i will stick to ronnie s cafe on cactus rd . as my go to breakfast joint .

1,"i can t believe we get to review a free publication . nonetheless , it s important to know especially for dave b . , who obviously didn t do his research that this magazine is published by a gentleman who grew up here in the valley and wanted a way to promote all of the great , creative people and activities they are doing by making a free magazine . he decided this years ago , and , despite pretty much breaking even it costs money to print and distribute thousands of magazines and no , the ads do not cover the full cost , continues doing so in the name of cultural awareness . notice that the photoshoots use local designers , local models , local photographers , and local locations . the articles are about artwork currently displayed in local galleries , businesses like restaurants and bands that local folks have started on their own from meager means , and about up and coming events like the taco festival started by a local , fashion shows again , utilizing local designers and run by locals no dillard s show coverage here and about people in the valley who are trying to make a difference in our community . if the magazine doesn t seem critical enough , it s because the people who are the magazine decide what to write about , and therefore don t have to waste pages with hateful criticism when java can be promoting a local chef or a cool new local jewelry designer . when it s run by a local , written by locals , and put together in the publisher s dining room , i can t think of any magazine with more credibiilty and freedom . the publisher and writers are meticulous in choosing to write about what moves them rather than what the latest hype is . that s why you read a story about the man who purchased a building and was designing it into a venue before it was the crescent ballroom . that s also why you ll read the backstory on five locally owned , little known coffee houses at far ends of the valley . the candid shots in the back are a tribute to local events the publisher attended but maybe an article hasn t been written about , or to local artists , designers or patrons of the arts . while it s always interesting to hear what people think of java , knowing what really goes on behind the scenes gives me nothing but respect for the handful of folks to who put their blood sweat and tears into creating this free publication each month .

1,"i ve not stayed at this resort , but have been here twice once for a wedding and the other for a lunch learn event . valet service each time was quick and the guys were professional and pleasant . the grounds of the resort are kept meticulously clean and there were clear skies and greenery everywhere i looked so beautiful . lunch learn aug th the event started a little past noon and ended a little past pm . we reserved for six , but it s based on a first come , first served basis . two of us arrived a little after am and after paying our respective fee , went to find a table that would afford us good views of the chef s station . unfortunately the best tables with direct views of the chef s station had reserved placards on them , so we ended up with one off to the right of the chef s station . i would recommend arriving early to grab good seats tables are set for ten . there are two large tv screens in the room , in case you re not able to see the chef directly . our event was hosted by chef macmillan gave the guests a few good laughs , with featured guest chef kevin binkley owner of binkley s restaurant in cave creek . the servers weren t obtrusive and kept our water and wine glasses full . we started off with a glass of champagne , which wasn t great , but was appreciated and added to the festive ambiance . for this event , we were served three courses an appetizer chilled cucumber soup , entr e two wash ranch chicken , and dessert huckleberry semi fredo . each course was paired with a different glass of wine john anthony sauvignon blanc white , appetizer , andre brunel cote du rhone red , entr e , and pietro rinaldi moscato d asti dessert . i m not usually a fan of sauvignon blanc i favor riesling , but the john anthony won me over . chef binkley went over his background and demonstrated the process that goes with making the chilled cucumber soup which is quite involved . the soup , albeit a bit salty , was so good . everyone raved about it , and the best part of the dish for me was the charred red onion . the two wash ranch chicken entr e was good overall however , my chicken was a bit dry and tough to cut . this might be a one off thing since others at the table said their chicken was moist . loved the sweet potato puree and chantrell mushrooms . the only real complaint i had was the lack of a demo for the entree and dessert . with that said , i can understand why the chef needed to be in the kitchen . . . after all , we needed to eat , right ? p other highlights live band entertained with great hits a bit loud though for lunchtime recipes to take home q a with the chef and photo ops raffles for a few prizes , which two of my friends won a gift box of caramel brownies and one night stay at the sanctuary with dinner wedding friday , march rd the ceremony was held at pm on the grounds near the ballroom . the weather was a bit warm , but not unbearably so . the bride and groom were beautiful so was the service , but it was a bit distracting to see people observing us from the windows of the jade bar , which overlooked the grounds where the ceremony was held . after the ceremony , we took a short hike up the stairs for cocktail hour , held just outside the ballroom . it was such a beautiful experience to have a glass of wine , nibble on hors d oeuvres , chat with friends , and watch the sun go down with the mountains as a backdrop . the reception was held in the ballroom and was decorated beautifully . the food was great , the wine and alcohol was flowing , and the live latin band made for a great evening . my friend used sanctuary s wedding planner and caterer and they did a great job .

1,"even for meat eaters , green has a lot to love . a lot more than just tofu ! i go here at least a couple times a month for lunch and it s spectacular of the time . a few of our favorite items are the bbq chicken sandwich , thee argentine sandwich , the crab puffs and of course , the tsoynamis . everything is fairly priced for a sandwich , . for a bowl w your choice or rice or noodles . the only thing i don t particularly care for is the buffalo wings as i think they are far too salty . the ranch that it comes with is fantastic , though . also , if you get something with cheese make sure to use daiya instead of teese . daiya tastes much better , in my opinion . the atmosphere is very artsy . there are always paintings for sale and there are a bunch of old car doors and hub caps over to one side . they just got a few booths which is fantastic if you want a little privacy . there is free wifi , a booshelf will all sorts of great reading , and the staff is always super friendly . another great thing about green is the vegan market . they have all sorts of great vegan foods and books for you to spoil yourself with . it s the only place i know of where you can find teese , food for lovers queso and soy curls . as an aside , i highly recommend soy curls as a healthy replacement to the meat in your fajitas or cheesesteaks . another thing you absolutely must check out is their annual thanksliving festival on thanksgiving . they will load you up will all sorts of delicious and traditional thankgsiving day food , veganized . turkey , stuffing , biscuits , brussels sprouts , asparagus , cranberry sauce , gravy , corn , pie and a drink . you ll get guest speakers , live music and local arts and crafts . highly recommend .

0,"if i had written this review prior to an incident in september it would easily be stars . the bar tenders were awesome . one night i was carrying around a largeish trophy why because i own one . i put it on the bar to order beer and they asked me if i wanted a glass or if i wanted them to put it in the trophy . yes , yes i did although they did have to pour the drink into the glass first cause the trophy was to big to properly fit under the tap . this might not be a big deal to some , but since i ve been kicked out of bars for drinking out of said trophy before and that was the first time i ve ever had a bar tender be so cool about it . every time i ve been hear the bar staff has rocked even when they are extremely busy . food . i think i ve eaten here once , so i m not going to comment on it . however i have been here when they switch from neighborhood bar mode to dance bar mode . if you are at a table still eating at that time they have no hesitation moving your table out of the way , if you re lucky they will tell you about it before hand . it s a good place for watching football ufc etc . could maybe use some more tv s . music is nothing outstanding , it s your typical dance top s etc that you would expect at any college dance bar . since the crowd often is college recent grads , it fits the bar nicely . i don t normally include bouncers in my reviews , but after what i saw the last time i was there , it s affected my opinion of the place and is the reason the place is only getting stars . if you are kicking someone out and the are leaving peacefully , there is no reason to put your hands on him , other than maybe to keep him from falling over the place . so when i see a bouncer aggressively pushing a guy who has thrown up his hands in surrender , and in the process the bouncer knocks over a girl who has done nothing wrong , that s just not cool . maybe it s just me but i would think someone who works for the bar should be picking her up off the ground instead of nearly trampling her to help the bouncer who put her there while throwing out someone who is giving them no resistence on his way out .

1,"thanks to everyone who put up with all the closed roads and driving detours yesterday for the marathon . as one of the largest marathons in the country it was really cool to see all the spectators , volunteers and bands supporting and encouraging the , runners . i finished the half marathon yesterday and the war wounds aren t nearly as bad , but i am sore as hell still . it became clear at the startline that we really have to do something about the capitol complex . that area is a disaster . thanks for all the carb heavy food and drink at the start and finish . i have never enjoyed spilling hot coffee all over myself up until yesterday morning . thanks to the ups drivers who hauled our stuff to the finish . the half marathon doesn t run through the most attractive parts of phoenix , but mcdowell road is definitely a step up from van buren . . that s for sure . could you imagine thousands of runners trying to dodge hookers on their way to the finish line ? and also , thanks to the guys in my running corral who dressed up and ran as the super mario bros mario and luigi . you guys rock .

1,"this cafe provided me with my first ethiopian cuisine experience . it was delicious and i am eager to go back . the most impressive thing to me was their selection of vegetarian dishes . they had as many options as those with meat which i really appreciate doesn t happen very often . the service was great . you can tell this is a family run restaurant that cares about their patrons . the food is very reasonably priced which make it easy to try a variety of dishes . we started with the shorba which is a lentil based soup . this was probably my favorite part of the meal , it was absolutely delicious satisfying and hearty . we also had the vegetable combination which had different dishes served on the injera , a crepe like bread you eat the main dishes with . this is a fun way to eat with your hands and opened up a new world of foods for us ! can t wait to go back and devour a bowl of shorba . "
1,"great service by the owner nick . he s very accommodating and aims to please . friendly and helpful . i hadn t had an indian fry bread in over years . there were several meat choices to choose from and several vegetables to add on top . unfortunately an earlier catering order cleaned them out of re fried beans and bell peppers . the salsa was good , spicy but not hot . the owner kept the place open for me to enjoy my meal while we chatted . he even stayed open later to feed another customer that walked in after the place had been closed for mins . he even gave me a coupon for my next visit . a truly caring owner . nice place in a strip mall with plenty of parking .

1,i had dinner at the true food in scottsdale on a thursday a couple of weeks ago . there is really nothing not to like here . the restaurant itself is great looking and will be wonderful when the weather warms up as all the walls are glass doors . i thought alcohol was well priced or least the wine was as you get glasses starting at . we shared the lettuce cups as an appetizer and they were quite tasty although messy to eat as are all the dishes that use lettuce as a tortilla . i had the puttanesca with a twist no anchovies instead with ahi tuna it was quite tasty and was a right sized portion . my sister in law had a tofu curry that also was quite flavorful even though i am not a fan of curry and can take or leave tofu . head the chocolate cake for dessert which was just right . i will definitely go back all in all a pleasant evening . 
0,this place wasn t that great for the price . i spent on mini grilled cheese sliders and a tea basically bar food over priced not much to choose from on the menu plus portion size didn t equal out to what i paid for . the crowd is very scottsdale and the staff wasn t that friendly . definitely wont go back here again . 
0,"for vegan fare , it s passable . i liked the food , but not totally in love with it . the teas were the best though , and didn t have any dessert but it sounded amazing . "
1,"i loved this place ! a bit pricey , but excellent quality . been here twice and haven t had anything we didn t like . the meat is great quality and they ll cook it how you desire as opposed to places that won t cook something below medium well . great toppings for burgers , fries and shakes . although everything is so big and filling i certainly can t have all that in one trip ! definitely a decadent tasty treat .

1,amazing greek food ! definitely try the greek fries ! i always try to come here every time i am in phoenix . staff is also always very friendly ! also try the greek calamari . unusually delicious ! 
1,"on top of how good the food is , their customer service is excellent . i went to eat there on thursday the th , and had the best server ever . he was the bartender as well , and still payed tons of attention to my table . he was very nice , and very helpful . he had extensive knowledge of the menu . he was also very personable . he laid out samples of their various barbeque sauces while giving some details about each one . he squirted them out onto an extra plate he brought to the table , and he made the shape of a smiley face with all the sauces . he made that dining experience so good that i wish i could write a review about him personally and suggest to his managers that he get a raise ! i couldn t hear him when he stated his name over a large group that had just come in and was moving tables , but he was wonderful . also , one of the people with me is from the east coast , and likes vinegar based barbeque sauce . they didn t have any of that kind in their current rotation of sauces , and he actually went back to the kitchen and explained the situation . a lady from the kitchen made a vinegar based barbeque sauce from scratch just because one of us had mentioned how much we loved it . i ve never experienced service like that , and really can t say enough about how great this guy , and all other staff i came into contact with , was ! great job to whoever hired him . the food was delicious , i love their fries ! unlike anything you can get anywhere else . i got the country roasted chicken great seasoning , super moist and tender , while still having that chargrilled roasted skin my favorite . all of their sauces are so good it s hard to choose just one ! and no matter how many times i go there , i always sample each one again . all positive things to say about this famous daves ! oh and i forgot to mention the corn muffins . . . beyond words ! seriously , you have to try them . now i m craving one , and i m pretty sure they re not open at a . m . i wish i could order them by the dozen haha"
1,"some of the food here is fantastic such as the chicken corfu . and others like the gyro i found to be less than good becasue the meat was very dry some parts burnt with the obviously strong taste of fish . i sent it back and they took it off our bill . the remainder of the meal which consisted of the corfu , salads and soup was great and our waitress the owners daughter promised to address the gyro with the kitchen . this restaurant is located at the park in fountain hills with unobstructed views of the lake and fountain which erupts every hour spraying water more than feet in the air . we took a nice walk in the park after dinner which was very relaxing . recommended"
1,"great time , great location , ability to park in garage behind it . beautiful decor , candles , white furnishings , trimmed in wood . excellent vodka choices that will have you dancing on that raised table all nite which gives you a cool panoramic view of the place . see if you can spot the dj booth ! he s cool , friendly door staff . the bartenders kind of ignore you and there s a brunette girl bartender stay away from her . downer attitude , and she will charge you for drinks even though they have a for special . but it s a cool club and it s certain you ll have great time .

1,"this subway is one of the cleanest , and most efficient subways i have ever been to . i ve only been in the evenings , but i have to say every time i walk in , someone is always cleaning something . their employees are friendly and the food under the glass is fresh looking and appetizing and in their own bins . sometimes you can go to a subway and the prep area is a wreck . thats what makes this subway so great . everything is in it s place , and orderly and makes you feel like they take pride in their work . absolutely i will go here again , and i can t say that about many subways unfortunately .

0,"where i live in tempe , i can walk to the end of my street , hop on an orbit which takes me to the main bus depot or can drop me off closer to the light rail stop off of mill ave . not bad , right ? i actually am enjoying the clustering of a real bus depot not anywhere near a residential area with plenty of security , lighting , public enough space in an easily accessible location in tempe . i actually feel safe hanging out here at night and when i ride my bike to the station , all the bike racks face the security and transit office , so never had an issue with my bicycle here either . the buses themselves are fine , i have had some very bad moments on the bus with the passengers ie the st time i got on a phoenix bus , a knife fight broke out and i had to stay for a police report , another time two guys were reading hard porn right across from me , but its kinda nice mixing with people rather then being in a car tomb . what i very much have an issue with is most bus stations . i have had bums passed out dead ? on the seat , meth heads , a single sign with no seating in the hot blazing sun i am looking at you scottsdale , seats no shade around , fights break out at stations . i try to call the metro , they say it isn t their issue . call the police non emergency number , they say its the metro jurisdiction . for this very bad situation alone , i don t take the bus at night since all the stations near the arts area and central are not well lit , full of sketchy people and the buses take too long to come by if they even stop . for this i am grateful for the light rail for late night phoenix excursions . metro still has a lot of work to do , but considering the improvements i have seen with public transportation and bicycle awareness in the past years , it seems to be going on the right route .

0,"i ve eaten at quite a few yogis grills since they started opening up in arizona a handful of years ago . their teriyaki chicken is pretty good and you get quite a bit for your dollar . however ! ! ! two things . . no matter which location i go to the service always seems sub par . it seems everyone that works at yogis grill just seems uninterested and lacks the ability to be friendly . shrug its not overly bothersome to me but it would be nice to have friendlier service . . their sushi , is not that good and they are ridiculously over priced . i can go to kona grill which is a nice restaurant and get much better tasting sushi for nearly . cheaper ! i just can t get past how expensive their rolls are and it doesn t taste much better then grocery store sushi . i ll still go there for teriyaki but not for sushi , its just not worth it .

1,"decided on a whim at the last minute to go here for dinner tonight , i guess that s not the thing to do here . worked out perfect though , arrived at just about pm to see a hand full of people waiting and the the restaurant didn t open till pm . after a short debate we decided to stay , it helped that there was ample shade . the wait while hot was not uncomfortable and for the most part , newbies and veterans honored each others arrival order . seats is not much for a place that does this much business and it was surprising to learn that most waiting were from out of town . i also learned that reservations are accepted on line for parties of to and only reservations per night . reservations are usually to months out . luckily for us there was only one reserved table for ahead of everyone . o clock rolled around and the loading procedure ran smooth as clock work and we had drink and food orders in by quarter after . service was excellent and fast with just the right amount of time between salad and main course . i could not have asked for much more from my food , maybe a bit more basil on my mozzarella and tomato salad , everything was amazing including my mexican coke . we ordered pizzas , both wood fire baked to perfection . i could have eaten a whole loaf of the bread that comes with the salads , or for on its own . none of our food was greasy or soggy , the olive oil they use is excellent and the fresh mozzarella mouth watering . i will go back again , planning on getting there an hour before opening . although the food is amazing and well worth an hours wait in the phoenix sun and heat , i would not wait for to hours as some people do . so for me this was a win and a lucky last minute dinner decision .

1,"nestled between the bright lights of the once famous graham central station and a no name bbq place is a lovely gem i like to refer to as skips . the bar side of this place is nothing too special . don t get me wrong , its big for a bar , but the ambiance and furniture are pretty dated . so , unless you enjoy playing pool , i don t know why you would want to come here . that being said , the pool here is great ! they just got around brand new diamond tables which play awesome . their tables also play well , but they have some pretty unforgiving pockets . so if you are a beginner , i wouldn t play on the big tables unless you like to be frustrated . they have no house cues on the floor . you have to rent them up at the bar for . . this is great because they can maintain a better quality cue for you if you use house cues . their food is actually really good ! i ve had their turkey burger which was moist and delicious . it comes with a nicely sized basket of fries . also , their nachos are ridiculous good that s saying a lot coming from me ! the only bad thing about their nachos is that they use that liquid fake cheese . . . i prefer shredded blends on my nachos . the waitresses there are uber friendly . yes , uber ! they always make a point to remember your name and they are always sooo busy ! make sure to tip them well . they will remember you ! wednesday night is league night there , so unless you want to watch , avoid wednesday from pm . oh , and hh is from and lots of the food including the nachos and turkey burger are priced to sell ! go shoot some pool !

1,"there re times when you eat something and you want more . then there are times when you eat something and you instantly know you will never have anything quite like it . for me , i experienced both of those at pizzeria bianco . my buddy and i drove almost miles from santa barbara for a giants diamondbacks game and thought we d try this place i had heard about . we arrived fairly late so there was about a one hour wait but man , was it worth it . we ordered a biancoverde and a wiseguy . i was a bit skeptical at first because they each didn t have tomato sauce like i was used to , but i realized i dont care much for tomato sauce in the first place and i m always up for trying new things . best decision of the day . the biancoverde was my favorite . it was so simple cheeses , arugula , and olive oil yet so amazing . it has left me wanting more to this day . the staff was nice and friendly , not to mention a few cuties . i will definitely drive miles for it again . in fact , i ll be making my way to phoenix in a few weeks , just for the pizza !

0,worse pizza i have had in a while . we ordered slices and they tasted like they had been sitting out for a while and nuked . crappy service too . salad was plain and all oil no vinegar for dressing . . service half ass . i am surprised they have remained in business fo several years . also they apparantly have no ac it was very warm inside even on a slightly chilly day in nov so we sat outside the inside was so hot and stuffy . this place totally sucks .

0,"i admit i m not a huge bbq fan , as it usually makes me feel like exploding afterwards but since my dining partner loves bbq , we ve eaten here a lot . the meat is pretty good but at least one of the meats has been dry each time i ve been . my favorite has been the ham . the spicy bbq sauce is pretty darn tasty too . i ve found myself putting black pepper on the mac and cheese to spice it up and haven t been all that impressed with the rest of their sides either . i m a big fan of sides at bbq places , even more than the meat , so when sides disappoint i get sad . i dumped out their homemade root beer after one sip . don t know what was about it but it was very off for me , and i seriously love root beer . my dining partner loved it so ehhh . . . maybe it s just me . the place is very interesting on the inside , the decor reminds me of a mid century cafeteria but more modern . they have a huge hand painted mural of a farm and a large outdoor seating area for parents to let their kids run around in while they eat . joe s gets packed . i ve seen the line wrap around to the outside on the weekends . i don t think it s worth waiting the minutes in line for , but then again i don t think a lot of places are worth that wait for cafeteria style dining .

1,"so we finally decided to give cibo another chance and i m so glad we did ! i love love love their patio . it s very cute and romantic especially with all the lights wrapped around the trees . the heaters keep you warm on a chilly night and it s much quieter than their indoor space . this place is a great date spot . we both had the prosciutto cruda pizza and had wanted to try the burrata , but unfortunately they d been out of it for the last week so we ordered the bruschetta instead . our waiter also recommended the valpolicella ripasso , which was ok , but it was a little light for our tastes . the pizza was really good the fresh ingredients really come through , but we weren t the biggest fans of the crust . i like something more substantial and airy . but for a thin crust pizza it wasn t soggy at all . a big plus ! the bruschetta was also ok don t get me wrong i still ate all of it and would order it again , but each bite just needs a little more of a punch . service was great and we met karen , the owner , before we left and she is a doll . we had a much better experience this time around and we will certainly be back .

0," stars for uniqueness this place has very interesting food and flavors that aren t common around here . stars for the staff everybody was very fast and friendly . stars for coolness of the location and the establishment i mean it is pretty cool that this place is in a nicely redone year old house in a cool part of downtown phoenix . parking is a pain though . however . . . . . besides feeling hip , cool , urban and trendy i also felt hungry and ripped off after leaving . sure , i could sit there for hours sipping saki and trying every one of their tapas and probably be ok hunger wise but i would not be ok with the tab per person that it would surely be . for me this is more of a fun interesting place to go before you go out to dinner .

1,"don t let the name deceive you . beaver choice is an excellent dining experience . my girlfriend and i decided on a whim to give it a shot after making the obligatory puns and double entendre s on the name . after staring at the menu for two minutes , trying desperately to decipher what we were to have , we gave up and asked the guy behind the counter s advice . his name was chris and he was extremely helpful . he sold us with free samples , rather than descriptions of the plate . i ordered the gravlax my girlfriend ordered the laxpudding . we entrusted the quality of our meal to the word of chris and the small sample we tasted , because , in my mind , the ingredients had no business being together in one dish . both dishes were based on lox , aka smoked salmon . we were both pleasantly surprised at the dish that greeted each of us a few minutes later . the food was excellent ! and while not the cheapest dinner in the world , you get an enormous bang for your buck . your plate is literally stacked with food . kudos if you finish it all . bottomline beaver choice has a weird ass name , but it serves some of the best food in tempe . we will be back for sure , and i encourage each of you to give it a shot . i guarantee you won t come away disappointed !

1,"first , i m sorry this review is lengthy , but i really want people to understand how far a little kindness can go . i entered mimi s cafe at the end of possibly worst day ever . i came in looking to order food for takeout and get home to drown my sorrows in comfort food . i was directed by the hostess up front to go stand by the bakery and i would be able to order take out . i waited not seconds and was greeted with a huge smile from a lovely girl named danielle . she gave me a menu and told me to ask if i had questions and inquired if i had been there before . i looked at the menu for some time , unable to clear my mind enough to decide . she told me i was welcome to take a seat , and when i apologized for taking so long she responded with a smiley where s the fire ? take your time , can i get you a glass of wine while you decide ? wine was a perfect idea ! i finally ordered and sat drinking my wine . i waited , and then waited a little longer , danielle the young girl doing take out informed me the kitchen was working as fast as they could but are very busy , she apologized for the wait and offered complimentary bread and convinced me to buy a a second glass of wine . when she brought me the second glass i had just gotten off the phone and was visibly shaken with more bad news . somehow this young girl had the courage to ask if everything was alright and what she could do to help . it was just the olive branch i needed . just the inquiry was enough to make me feel better . i told her i was fine and thanked her for her compassion . finally my food was ready . she boxed everything with care for the drive home . all this time smiling . i couldn t help but notice danielle interact with the other employees they always laughed or high fived her with each exchange . she had brightened my day , and it was clear she is a light for others in mimi s cafe . this is the kicker . . . my bill was and some change . . . i gave her what i thought was two dollar bills , but in reality was a and a . the young girl ran outside and stopped me saying sir , i m not sure these bills are right . i was overwhelmed by her honesty and told her no , i thought they were two s but the difference would be her reward for honesty . the food was tasty and just what i needed . mimi s cafe is a friendly place worth the wait for food or a table , and if mimi s cafe reads these reviews know that you have a superstar in danielle .

0,"let me first say that we are fans of the w hotel and have stayed in many of their hotels around the nation and are overall happy with the accommodations and customer service . i m a local phoenician who resides in the arcadia neighborhood and frequents many of the wonderful restaurants and hotels this city has to offer . after hearing many negative reviews from co workers , family , and friends , my fianc and i decided to give the w hotel scottsdale a shot prior to forming an opinion of our own for this hotel restaurant bar . during a night out on the town with visiting and local friends , we opted to give this place a try . upon approaching the entrance of the bar , security tells us that we re not welcome here due to one of the members of our party not having closed toe shoes and another not having a collared shirt . the attire our group was wearing was more than appropriate for any phoenix scottsdale restaurant bar . let me remind you that s is july in phoenix , and over one hundred degrees at the time of night we went to the w and the six of us just finished a dinner at an adjacent , popular restaurant . the staff was flat out rude to not only us , but others in line wanting and willing to spend money and support the local hotel . i will strongly suggest not staying here or supporting the quality of business they are running here . during a time of a slowing economy and tourism , many businesses are forced to rely solely on the best possible customer service to attract and retain business the w hotel fell way short of this . i was very discouraged after our experience here and will agree with the many other reviewers that this place in not worth supporting . phoenix scottsdale has many great places to experience , so don t settle for this place .

1,"we were craving some bbq , and hadn t been here in a while , so we decided to head over . it wasn t overly crowded on a sunday night , but it wasn t empty , either . hubby and i ordered the same thing , meat combo brisket and baby back ribs with double grilled veggies extra grilled . for some reason , we both got the same thing , sometimes that happens . first , we got our cornbread , which is always so delicious . they serve it with butter , but you don t really need it . our meals came quickly we didn t order appetizers , so we dug right in . the brisket , as usual , melted in my mouth . it s probably one of the best places i ve ever been for brisket , and that s saying something . i always order it wherever we go . also , my husband is not a brisket eater , but he will order it here . now for the ribs , i need to let you know , i m a sweet savory bbq fan , definitely not spicy . i ve had the ribs before , and they were always sweet and tender , plus they literally fall off the bone . these were like they usually are , fall off the bone and tender . but , there seemed to be a spicier rub on them , which was a little off putting to me . even my husband mentioned it , and he doesn t mind a little heat . neither one of us remember them tasting that way . i dipped them in the sweet bbq sauce , and that seemed to cool the spice a bit , and i did eat them all , but i m not sure i d get them again . and , lastly , the grilled veggies , which consist of green peppers , zucchini , squash , onion and mushrooms wonderful ! ! i love the charred grill taste , and i gently dip them in the sauce . i really adore them ! we rarely get dessert , because we re so full . we have taken some cobbler home before , but it s never quite the same as having it fresh from the kitchen . plus , they bring you each a fresh mini sugary doughnut with your bill . these are the perfect finish to a very good bbq meal . they bring them to you in a bag , but to be honest , they ve never made it out the door . the only reason i m giving this restaurant and meal stars instead of , is because of the rub on the ribs . other than that , it was a perfect meal . "
1,"this is a family owned local restaurant at it s best . if you like to explore and support locally owned businesses , you should definitely give this one a try . they have a big menu and i have tried breakfast and lunch and both were excellent , but the breakfast is particularly good . i love the breakfast burrito . to the reviewer that complained about the greasy chorizo . . . hello , it is chorizo , chorizo is sausage . i would go out of my way to stop and eat here whenever in the general area .

1,"i ve been to both locations , and i wonder if is fair to rate them together or should i do it separate ? the phoenix location is way to small for me , i don t like feeling like i m almost sitting on my fellow diners lap and , this is a huge pet peeve of mine , i hate smelling like food ! which is inevitable because the place is tiny . on the other hand it does have charm to it and the food is delicious . the scottsdale location i can move , don t smell like food when i get out but is more sterile . and then there s the food . . . . i always ordered fried chicken of course ! and the breast tends to be dry so i decided to do thigh and drumstick . well , this last time the dark meat was fried to a burn and not only the skin but the meat too . i should have asked for two different pieces but i was starving , and my hunger won . a shame because i left without satisfying my craving for good fried chicken . the waffle was delicious as always and i ordered smothered potatoes which were very good . it seems with their mac cheese people either love it or don t . i m on the don t group . it tastes milky and not very cheesy to me . i may try it again , because i love mac cheese and i have the hope that maybe it was just bad luck before ? service is ok , sometimes better than others . after careful consideration , i ll give it stars . i ll visit again , i m pretty sure , and then i may go up or down one star .

1,"well , i ve been to liberty market several times now and it s time to add my two cents . yes , i know , there are already reviews , what more could i add ? don t worry , i ll stick to the facts consider this the cliff notes version . take the first parking spot you can find or drive the the lot west of the building . walk in , grab a menu , and get in line . with all of the goodness on the menu , try to make your decision before you get to the register . a few of my favorites . cortadito coffee drinkers , do not miss this one ! cuban miro latte , on the sweeter side , served in a pair of espresso shots or a bowl , perfection ! . rancher salad steak , caramelized onions , blue cheese , arugula , do i have to keep going ? . sweet potato salad a unique salad , so much better than your average potato salad . cinnamon rolls the size of a human face , if you re into to that kind of thing , share with a friend , or four . there are more , but i promised to keep it short . back to the line . as you re making up your mind , be ready to answer the number of people in your party so they can set you up with a table . try to resist the incredible looking , super sized pastries and desserts in the case , or not , what the heck , just get it ! . pay the friendly cashier , proceed to the fountain drink station to fill your glasses , and maneuver the maze of tables to find the one with your number . just a few tips . one , it can get a little noisy in there , so may not be the best place if you re planning a discussion over your meal . two , lm gets busy and the staff is always trying to find a table for the guests in line by the time they finish at the register . so , while the dining room attendants are friendly and attentive , they are definitely trying to turn the table as soon as you ll let them . and now you know what to expect . if you don t like lines or loud places , this might not be your favorite place . overall , delicious , fresh food and shinny , happy people to bring it to you . let s just say lm is enough to get me out of my five mile ahwatukee radius , and that is hard to do ! now you know the scoop . . . i m out ! enjoy !

0,"first off made a reservation and arrived to be seated next to the extremely hot rotisserie . very uncomfortable , not to mention it was degrees outside that day . i asked to be seated elsewhere but the hostesses excuse was that this was all that was available due to reservations . well i made reservation but she just made another excuse that we needed to be a larger party to sit elsewhere . i gave it two stars only because my family likes their bbq i don t .

1,"i stumbled in here craving breakfast because it was very close to the airport and very close to the aloft hotel i was staying at . yes , i am a tourist and yes , i am from a part of the us where cowboys are not common , so walking into a place full of country western paraphanalia made me smile . the service was good , the food was delicious , and i walked out with a few good photos . the coffee was a tad bit weak , but i m a starbucks bold drinker , so i don t hold it against them . "
0,"no , i don t want to take the bus to get to the train . in my opinion , they didn t go far enough for people who live in phoenix . it may be a good solution for tempe and mesa residents commuting to phoenix , but it isn t effective for phoenicians who want to get from the north valley into cenpho . "
1," stars all the way . let me begin by saying that i m a big fan of the products . the store is done in very warm tones and the drinks are incredibly aromatic and these things combines seem to make all my stress melt away when i step in the door . i m not a huge coffee fan , but i can order some of the coffee drinks here . i m completely unable to drink the caramel frappuccino from starbucks , but i can t get enough of the caramel ice blended from coffee bean tea leaf . so now that we ve established that i love the product , we can move on to the real reason this place gets a star review the staff . i ve never seen anything like it . if you come in times someone will probably know your name and might even know your drink . leila is the best at this . she knows peoples names , their drinks and if you come there often enough she even knows which car you drive . she ll see a regular customer s car pull up and she ll have the normal drink ready and waiting for them by the time they walk through the door . that is the epitome of customer service .

0,"decent little taco stand sort of restaurant . the burrito that i had was good , nothing to shout about , but a solid breakfast burrito . the nice thing about it was that you can order breakfast foods all day and it still tasted good . mine came out pretty quick , but my friend s burrito was quite long in arriving . they have some good combination burritos that aren t significantly more expensive like the ones you might try to get at other places . i would visit again to get a second opinion of the place .

1,"mmmm , canadian comfort food ! we re huge keg fans , and when we moved from canada to tempe earlier this month we had to take the kids to the keg . i love how consistent they are with the quality of service and the extras for the kids . the service is a little lacking compared to most canadian kegs i ve been to , simply because the staff seemed so much younger and less professional , but it was still really good . the food quality was excellent , but the portions are very canadian read smaller than us portions while the prices are still what you would expect from vancouver yet in an area where the cost of living is about rd . for the money , i d probably rather hit ruths chris . . minus the kids "

1,"the best part about this place is the cozy atmosphere . we took our dog with us for dinner , and we were able to sit on the patio . so if you have a four legged family member , this is a nice chill place , with very good service . i had the crab cake blt , and although it sounds unappealing , it was surprisingly good . my better half had the windsor burger , but commented that the burgers at deluxe are much tastier . the signature drinks are decent , but definitely on the sweet side . there appeared to be a good wine and beer list , which i will most likely opt for next time . bottom line i would go back without hesitation .

0,"i give this location no love . we went to this one rather than the one uptown on a saturday night with a voucher from another location from a bad sushi upchuck experience . going late at night with a mostly empty restaurant , we still ended up waiting minutes to be sat , then shoved and i mean shoved in next to the only other table in the place the hostess snickered at me when i kindly asked to move a single table down really sick of bitchy hostesses in scottsdale by the way your job is not that hard so shut up and color for christs sake our waitress took another minutes just to greet us , sushi took forever , and if you can believe it the fun hadnt even begun yet . when paying the bill , we present the voucher to the waitress , who says she cant take it . the manager came over with a bitchy look , basically trying to call it bull shyt and continued to give us the th degree about it for the next few minutes certainly not appreciated . she takes it to the point where she calls the other location where we got it taking another minutes and finally gives us our bill back only taking off our rolls and nigiri . this created one pissed off yelper instantaneously . don t bother with this location you could find bomb shrapnel in your soup and they still wouldnt give a damn . and for the sake of all that is holy stop with the crazy i m too sexy for myself scene ! you re not that cool !

1,china garden is one of those places that i crave . i use to live not far from here as i was going through high school and a few years after . i now live in the surprise area but about every two months or so i go out of my way to china garden for the yummy sesame chicken and teriyaki wings . there sweet and sour pork is also something to be desired . china garden does chinese food the way it was done in the late eighties and early nineties . it s what i grew up knowing and came to love . the sweet and sour pork has the wonderful breading and is left to soak in the sweet and sour sauce . chinese food by today s standards leaves me feeling bloated and disappointed so i pass it up more and more . the only regret when i eat china garden is that it will be a while before i get to go back . the egg drop soup is also some of the best in the valley . you have to go try it . i have been going here since and still love it . p . s . they do take out and the portions are huge for the price
0,"narcisse couldn t be more appropriately named . . . another scottsdale scene club with a lively but predictable crowd of scantily dressed cougars , middle eastern royalty and upscale business folk . the music is hoppin and thumpin late and leans toward house , which is why i added two stars . we actually entered by taking an elevator up and walking through a kitchen in rather cinematic style , emerging right onto the dance floor , which was packed . i guess it pays to know someone . the champagne selection is outrageous here and packed though it was , our drinks arrived in seconds . the sky high patio is a nice place to chill and check out the little skyline , but it s all about getting your dance on here . i would like to check it out for happy hour when fewer people are bumping into you and stepping on your feet . the russian mobster channeling bouncers are a little intimidating , but treated us well . an uber enthusiastic dancer knocked into my friend and shattered her veuve glass , and all was whisked and mopped in seconds . the music sure beats the tired s cover bands that seem to be epidemic in this area .

0,"my part jewish friend has been raving about this deli so come payday we went to check it out . ive been in phoenix a little over a month and have been getting sick from the food here . . . diarrhea lots , shit my pants once . . . anyway , i like to eat in divey non american cuisine . this place aint seedy enough for me , i suppose . i did not get ill from the food here however . . . . . for a sandwich , fries , and a dollop of soggy coleslaw ? ? ? i kept hearing from my friend , his mom and the waitress that the sandys are huge . nope . thought we might split one . nope . my sandwich was flavorless . . err . . thats a lie . . it tasted like stale bread . . for sandwiches and sodas its an effin sandwich ! ! ! . i only had only ? left the waitress . gave my friend the other to put toward a plane ticket to new york where he might experience kosher and a bit of his heritage on a more realistic scale . . . the fries were good tho .

0,"ugh . i don t like giving a tough review , but this is a store that needs to address a couple things . . the service long lines and unpleasant cashiers . . outdated store this wouldn t be so obvious if they just did a little cleanup and merchandising . . produce maybe in this store they should just no offer produce . the little corner in the store makes you think it was an afterthought . i think just a couple things that wouldn t cost much money would go a long way in making this store a go to place for me . not there right now .

1,"when i get the urge to eat out , i m normally drawn to more laid back restaurants where i can sit back , chat , and enjoy my meal . with a relaxing atmosphere and fun menu chicken waffles , and s mores for dessert , i definitely enjoyed this place . my first time here was for a yelp event so i was able to try just about everything . my favorites would have to be the mac cheese and the beef brisket both delicious ! i d say they ve got their bbq technique mastered , at least where the brisket is concerned . and the cornbread is probably the best i ve had so happy they handed out the recipe at the event . the service was great everyone was friendly and very helpful . i was satisfied with everything here and definitely would come back and probably leave with tasty leftovers !

1,"if i won the lottery and just wanted to spend a few hours a week working , it would have to be in this store . one , because i would want to be there just to see all the things all the time , and two , because i would be able to spend all my money there . this place rocks . this place has three buildings the west one has pricier items , but the stuff is gorgeous see previous lotto winning comment . the east one has very reasonably priced items , contains seasonal trinkets and specialty food items . the south building has kids stuff , pet items and clothing purses as well as some home items . it is the best place to find a gift for someone , or spend your overtime check on something nice for yourself . want nice stationary ? a cute soup tureen ? a garden item ? new collar for your dog ? fake fruit for your centerpiece ? gorgeous picture frames ? cute gauzy dress ? hip handbags ? pretty bangles ? antique key holders ? whimsical signage ? artful platters ? decorative bird cages ? catch my drift ? they have everything !

0,i m rather undecided about this place . the hygienists are great and the staff is all very nice and accommodating . every time i have to have a tooth filled yes i m totally that person i feel like i have to go back because something is wrong . for example not being able to floss between any of the filled teeth because the filling hasn t been filed down correctly . i don t feel like the dentist really listens to you either . when i felt like i had a problem with a tooth he told me it was fine and the next time i went back he found a huge cavity in that same tooth and told me i might need a root canal on it because it was so big . what a pain .

1,sauce is a great quick serve place . i had the chix caesar salad it was large and filling and quite good . the sangria is nice as well . . . i like the koolaid touch around the edge of the glass . my man had the bruchetta caprese style and it was awesome . . . the tomatoes were perfectly ripe and the mozzarella was fresh and creamy . the bread was a really crusty yet fluffy yet able to hold up to the mix piece of wonder . . . we found out they get it from labrea . if you want a great quick lunch or dinner check it out . . . we look forward to trying the pizza and pasta next time !

0,"a hand job with gardening gloves . . . . . i went looking for scottsdale auto salon to get a hand wash tint quote on my new mini today . finding it out of business , i whipped out my handy dandy yelp iphone app looking for a nearby alternate to at least get the wash done and found classic car spa . expecting to pay a bit more for a traditional hand wash i was surprised to find a machine assisted process . i d spent way to long trying to locate the place thank you google maps so i just opted for their supreme wash , which includes both interior and exterior detail . my son and i watched the car move through the process and saw that at least the wash part was done by hand , but they used the same mitts from the filthy truck that had gone through previously . star after seeing this , i should have watched their interior detail more closely . when i got the car back there were lines of dirt in my white roof , and water spots on the accent chrome . when we got in the car there still bits of chip on the seat and floor mat from my sons spill the day , and it was obvious that the dash and interior hadn t been detailed . unless they refrain from using any product what so ever on the interior of the car . the dash and steering wheel were bone dry and dusty . star i should have brought it up to someone , but my husbands and sons hunger won over and we just left . thankfully all of their other locations are to far out of the way to bother detouring to again . the staff was friendly , and their waiting area was pleasant with lots of drink choices , although i m not sure their waiting area was comfy enough for anything longer than a wash .

1,"i work right down the street from press and have been a huge fan from my very first visit ! the staff is unbelievably friendly and extremely passionate about their craft ! everything from the food to the coffee is first rate ! they always accommodate my special requests a little more of this , none of that and always make good suggestions when i m looking for something new . i love the yogurt and granola parfait strawberry and vanilla yogurt for me with a bit of honey and light granola for breakfast with a white chocolate latte . also , the breakfast burritos are perfectly creative and filling . for lunch , my favorite is the cactus club panini with a small side salad . also worth mentioning is that they have the very best iced coffee around . they call it an iced toddy and any one of the employees would be happy to tell you how it is different from regular coffee . i just know that it tastes amazing and seems to have a bit more of a caffeine kick ! my favorite part about press are their delectable desserts ! the berry mascarpone cake pretty much makes you feel like you ve won the lottery . and the ghirardelli brownies and chocolate chip cookies warmed up are a weekly addiction of mine . starbucks is a thing of the past . i m lucky to be in close proximity to press , but i think i would even make the drive just for that mascarpone cake !

1,"being too frugal to rip out a perfectly good , if not ugly , bathroom vanity top , i decided to look for ways to improve upon the cultured marble s look that was going on . after talking with my co worker and fellow yelp er , robert , i decided to go the refinish route instead of rip it out and put in new . after checking the internet i came across a company called miracle method . if you get a chance and you re thinking of having your bathtub , tile , vanity or kitchen countertop replaced , check out this company first ! i did get an estimate on ripping out the tile around my tub and having a new floor installed , but that would have still left me with a no so great looking tub and an ugly vanity . oh , and the estimate i received from the other place didn t provide tile so after all was said and done , i wouldn t be saving anything . so i bit the bullet and decided to spend the , . so the job was started promptly at a . m . on tuesday by shawn . a very nice young man who obviously likes what he s doing . sometimes hard to find in folks these days ! tuesday involved cleaning , prepping and spraying the tub . wednesday the tub was finished off then the tile and vanity were prepped and sprayed . time on thursday was spent applying several layers of sealant to the tile area and vanity top . friday was a quick visit . shawn cleaned everything up and returned it to a much better than original version of a master bath . i m very happy about the final results and i m seriously considering having my main bathroom redone as well . again , if you re thinking about making changes to your bath or kitchen , check out miracle method as a possible solution to your problem ! i m a fan !

1,i hate thai food and i m not a huge fan of curry but this place has changed my mind . very reasonably priced and always a great option at lunch because they handle the traffic very well . not only am i back on the thai bandwagon but my favorite dish is the green curry seafood . 
1,this place was great . . . well as great as a doctors visit can be . they called us my son was the patient back within minutes and immediately saw a doctor . she was kind and took her time asked a lot of questions and did not hastily diagnose and fully explained to us what was going on with my son s health . 
1,"this is the largest urban park . moreover , that urban part is great because i am minutes from three major trailhead areas . for hiking i like many points of entry , one of my favorites is telegraph pass , this is on the south side of the mountain . a new recently remolded parking lot is found on desert foothills parkway . there is a paved path that is about a mile and at its end telegraph pass is to the left and desert classic is to the right . telegraph pass grows in steepness towards the top where there are some larger stairs . at the top , there is a bench and you can then continue on national trail . if you head west , you can reach a great ramada . from the pima canyon entrance i take the fire road to national , after the initial ascent it is just some rolling hills , i then make left to hidden valley where there is a great natural tunnel , follow this trail to reach fat man s pass , contrary to the name there is a narrow gap that fat men cannot pass luckily you can go around , this meets back up with national trail . many unique rock formations on this hike . for shorter easier hikes from this lot , you can do the east and west loops and beverly canyon all small trails that loop , and have a few nice views . for mountain biking my skills are not too advanced so i stick to the east end of desert classic , with mostly straight section and a few wash passes and slight hill inclines it s great for a novice rider .

1,i love that this restaurant can accommodate all types of people . it s a sports bar with family style entertainment ! the staff is always friendly and they aim to please . the food is always good and prices are very reasonable . the bar is on one side so it splits the families with children on the other side with an amazing area with tvs to play xbox and wii . check this place out . you won t be disappointed . 
0,"totally sufficient for a few rounds of pool or darts while keeping an eye on the tv screens they have mounted on the walls . just stick to the cheap pitchers of domestic beer . i ordered a rum and coke and it tasted like cleaning products . i would come back , but only if i didn t feel like driving all the way to lucky break in tempe .

1,fun place to get masks for all my robberies . i joke . but really you can get good masks at easley s . 
1,"i love gabriel . he does an amazing job every single time i m there . i generally get two peekaboo highlights put in , and a cut and style , and always leaving looking great . his attitude is always upbeat , it would be impossible to spend any time in his chair and not leave in a good mood . the salon is always clean and comfortable . i never feel like i m being forced into spending more money or buying product , but when i have a question about what i should be using in my hair gabe always makes excellent suggestions . i have recommended him a good friend and my mother and both love him . my mother even left her stylist of years to start going to him because of the excellent service he provides .
